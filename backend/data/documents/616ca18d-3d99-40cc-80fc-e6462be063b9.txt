# Intervals

An interval is the distance between two pitches. Intervals are fundamental to understanding harmony and melody in music.

Common intervals include:
- Perfect Unison: Same note
- Minor Second: One half step
- Major Second: Two half steps (whole step)
- Minor Third: Three half steps
- Major Third: Four half steps
- Perfect Fourth: Five half steps
- Perfect Fifth: Seven half steps
- Octave: Twelve half steps

# Circle of Fifths

The circle of fifths is a visual representation of the relationships among the 12 tones of the chromatic scale. It shows the number of sharps or flats in each key signature.

Moving clockwise adds sharps:
C (no sharps) → G (1 sharp) → D (2 sharps) → A (3 sharps) → E (4 sharps)

Moving counter-clockwise adds flats:
C (no flats) → F (1 flat) → Bb (2 flats) → Eb (3 flats) → Ab (4 flats)

# Time Signatures

Time signatures indicate how many beats are in each measure and which note value gets one beat.

Common time signatures:
- 4/4: Four quarter notes per measure (most common)
- 3/4: Three quarter notes per measure (waltz time)
- 6/8: Six eighth notes per measure (compound meter)
- 2/4: Two quarter notes per measure (march time)
