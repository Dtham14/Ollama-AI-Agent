ⓘ
; 19 February 1743 – 28 May 1805) was an Italian
composer
and
cellist
of the
Classical era
whose music retained a
courtly
and
galante
style even while he matured somewhat apart from the major classical musical centers. He is best known for a
minuet
from his
String Quintet in E
, Op. 11, No. 5 (
G
275), and the
Cello Concerto in B flat major (G 482)
. The latter work was long known in the heavily altered version by German cellist and prolific arranger
Friedrich Grützmacher
, but has recently been restored to its original version.

Boccherini's output also includes several guitar quintets. The final movement of the Guitar Quintet No. 4 in D (G 448) is a
fandango
, a lively Spanish dance.

Boccherini was born into a musical family in
Lucca
, Italy in 1743.

He was the third child of Leopoldo Boccherini, a
cellist
and
double-bass
player, and the brother of Giovanni Gastone Boccherini, a poet and dancer who wrote
libretti
for
Antonio Salieri
and
Joseph Haydn
.

Luigi received his first music lessons at age five by his father, who taught him cello, and then continued his studies at age nine with Abbé Vanucci, music director of a local cathedral, at San Martino.

When his son reached thirteen, Leopoldo Boccherini sent him to study in Rome with
Giovanni Battista Costanzi
.

In 1757 Luigi Boccherini and his father both went to
Vienna
, where the court employed them as musicians in the
Burgtheater
.

In 1768 Boccherini went to Madrid, entering in 1770 the employ of
Infante Luis Antonio of Spain
(1727–1785), younger brother of King
Charles III of Spain
. There, Boccherini flourished under royal patronage, until one day when the King expressed his disapproval at a passage in a new trio, and ordered Boccherini to change it. The composer, no doubt irritated with this intrusion into his art, doubled the passage instead, which led to his immediate dismissal. Then he accompanied Don Luis (the
Infante
) to
Arenas de San Pedro
, a little town in the
Gredos Mountains
in
Ávila
; there and in the nearest town of
Candeleda
Boccherini wrote many of his most famous works.

Later patrons included the French ambassador to Spain,
Lucien Bonaparte
(1775–1840), as well as King
Friedrich Wilhelm II
of
Prussia
(1744–1797), himself an amateur cellist,
flutist
, and avid supporter of the arts. Boccherini fell on hard times following the deaths of his Spanish patron (1785), his two wives (1785 and 1805), and his four daughters (1796, 1802 and 1804). He died in Madrid in 1805, survived by two sons.

His body lay buried in the
Pontifical Basilica of St. Michael
in Madrid until 1927, when his remains were repatriated and buried in the church of
San Francesco
in his native Lucca.

Much of Boccherini's
chamber music
follows models established by
Joseph Haydn
; however, Boccherini is often credited with improving Haydn's model of the string quartet by bringing the cello to prominence, whereas Haydn had frequently relegated it to an accompaniment role. Some sources for Boccherini's style are in the works of a famous Italian cellist,
Giovanni Battista Cirri
, who was born before Boccherini and before Haydn.

A virtuoso cellist, Boccherini often played violin repertoire on the cello, at
pitch
, a skill he developed by substituting for ailing violinists while touring. This supreme command of the instrument brought him much praise from his contemporaries (notably
Pierre Baillot
,
Pierre Rode
, and
Bernhard Romberg
), and is evident in the cello parts of his compositions (particularly in the quintets for two cellos, treated often as cello concertos with
string quartet
accompaniment
).

He wrote a large amount of chamber music, including over one hundred string quintets for two violins, viola and two cellos (a type which he pioneered, in contrast with the then common scoring for two violins, two violas and one cello), a dozen guitar quintets, not all of which have survived, nearly a hundred string quartets, and a number of
string trios
and
sonatas
(including at least 19 for the cello). His orchestral music includes around 30
symphonies
and 12 virtuoso
cello concertos
.

Boccherini's works have been catalogued by the French
musicologist
Yves Gérard
(1932–2020) in the
Gérard catalog
, published in London (1969), hence the "G" numbers applied to his output.

Boccherini's style is characterized by
Rococo
charm, lightness, and optimism, and exhibits much melodic and rhythmic invention, coupled with frequent influences from the guitar tradition of his adopted country, Spain.

Boccherini's music is heard in the 2003 feature film
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World
,
including the little known
Passa Calle
, from
La Musica Notturna di Madrid

(All performed by Jacques Lochet, violin and synthesiser.)
