# Training Documents Folder

📚 Place your music theory PDFs and documents here to train the AI.

## Supported File Types
- PDF (`.pdf`)
- Word Documents (`.docx`)
- Text Files (`.txt`)
- Markdown (`.md`)
- CSV (`.csv`)

## How to Use

### 1. Add Your Documents
Simply copy your music theory PDFs or documents into this folder.

### 2. Run the Training Script
From the `backend` directory, run:

```bash
python train_from_folder.py
```

### 3. Force Reprocessing (Optional)
If you've updated a document and want to reprocess it:

```bash
python train_from_folder.py --force
```

## What Happens?
- Each document is loaded and split into chunks
- Chunks are embedded using the embedding model
- Embeddings are stored in the ChromaDB vector database
- The AI can then use this knowledge to answer questions

## Notes
- Maximum file size: 10MB
- Duplicate files are automatically skipped (unless using `--force`)
- All documents are tagged as "bulk_import" for tracking
