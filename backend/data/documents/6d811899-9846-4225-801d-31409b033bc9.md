I owe a huge thanks to Robert Beezer for recommending PreTeXt (formerly

“MathBook XML”) as a means to authorMusic Theory for the 21st–Century

Classroom. His work creating the “world” of PreTeXt made it easier than I

could have imagined to create this text in all its forms (online, PDF, and print).

Also of incredible value, and without whom this text would not exist, is
Jahrme Risner, who helped me wrap my head around the nitty gritty of Pre-

TeXt and patiently coached me through entering commands in the terminal.

I wish to thank my colleague, Gwynne Kuhner Brown, for co–piloting the
use of this text at the University of Puget Sound and for suggesting extremely

helpful clarifications and corrections.

Finally, I must thank my wife, Dawn Padula, Director of Vocal Studies at
the University of Puget Sound and musician extraordinaire, for entertaining

my endless questions about my choices for musical examples and the clarity of

explanations and diagrams.

Preface

Music Theory for the 21st–Century Classroom is an openly–licensed online

four–semester college music theory textbook. This text differs from other mu-

sic theory textbooks by focusing less on four–part (SATB) voiceleading and

more on relating harmony to the phrase. Also, in traditional music theory

textbooks, there is little emphasis on motivic analysis and analysis of melodic

units smaller than the phrase. In my opinion, this led to students having dif-

ficulty with creating melodies, since the training they are given is typically to

write a “melody” in quarter notes in the soprano voice of part writing exercises.

When the assignments in those texts ask students to do more than this, the

majority of the students struggle to create a melody with continuity and with

appropriate placement of harmonies within a phrase because the text had not

prepared them to do so.

InMusic Theory for the 21st–Century Classroom, students learn about mo-
tive, fragment, phrase, and subphrase, as well as types of melodic alteration

like inversion, intervallic change, augmentation, diminution, rhythmic change,

ornamentation, extension, and retrograde. By understanding motive and sub-

phrase (also known as “phrase segment” or “phrase member”), I believe students

will better understand the logic and construction of melodies, which will aid

them in creating their own music.

This text is meant to take the student from the basics of reading and writing
pitches and rhythms through twelve–tone technique and minimalism over the

course of four semesters. Whenever possible, examples from popular music

and music from film and musical theater are included to illustrate melodic and

harmonic concepts, usually within the context of the phrase.

Performances of notated examples are linked to legal, copyrighted YouTube
videos with the start and stop time embedded to prevent the instructor the

need to search for the passage. The online nature of the text allows links

between related concepts (including the index) as well as to relevant pages on

the internet.

While I have considered creating a unique curriculum for the theory pro-
gram at my university since 2001, the impetus to create an online music theory

textbook that could be of use not only to my students but to students at other

colleges came from reading “Transforming Music Study from its Foundations:

A Manifesto for Progressive Change in the Undergraduate Preparation of Mu-

sic Majors” by the College Music Society’s Task Force on the Undergraduate

Music Major.

The ideas in “the Manifesto,” as it is often called—that colleges need to train
students to be composer–performer–improvisers (and I would add “arrangers”)

like Bach and Beethoven as well as Charlie Parker and Jimmy Page—resonated

with my musical experience growing up, which included writing, arranging, and

playing popular music on electric guitar, electric bass, keyboards, and drumset

in high school—both in my uncle’s home recording studio and with a garage

vii
viii

band I formed. It also resonated with my experiences playing jazz and fusion as

a professional bassist ever since I was in college, a situation where the majority

of the basslines I play are improvised from lead-sheet symbols.

My Ph.D. is in composition with a supporting area in music theory. I teach
students to write motets and fugues in the upper–division counterpoint class.

I believe in compositional craft. I also acknowledge that there are many things

one can value in music, including lyrics, groove, production, texture, emotion,

harmony, virtuosity, and intellect, to name a few. In this textbook I try to

cover as many as possible of these items that relate to how music is made and

how understanding can enrich one’s experience.

Basic Concepts

1.1 Pitch
Pitchhas to do with notes. On the piano there are 88 notes. As you move to
the right on a piano, the notes sound higher. Notes sound lower as you move
to the left. Try it on a piano with a smaller range at the following website.

1.2 Notation
Notes are written on a five-linestaff. Acleforients the lines to a reference
point. For example, the G clef, when placed on a five-line staff, becomes the
treble clef, the most well known clef. In treble clef, the notes on the lines are
E–G–B–D–F from lowest to highest, often remembered through the traditional
mnenomic “Every Good Boy Does Fine.” The spaces are F–A–C–E from lowest
to highest. Staves (the plural of “staff” in musical terminology is “staves”) are
extended by theledger lines.

1.3 Octave Registers
The note names used in music are ABCDEFG (known as the “musical alpha-
bet”). After G, the note A returns and ABCDEFG occurs again and again.
1
2 CHAPTER 1. BASIC CONCEPTS
The distance from the first A to the second A is an octave (which means the
notes are eight steps apart.)
A B C D E F G A
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 (octave)
The distance from any note to a note of the same name in the next register
above or below is called anoctave(abbreviated “8ve”).
How can the piano keyboard have 88 notes when there are only seven note
names? The musical alphabet repeats 7 times (with an extra ABC at the
top), which means we have at least seven octave registers. (There are also five
chromatic notes in each register, which we will learn about when we discuss
Accidentals.) When learning about octave registers, we will focus on the note
C for reasons that will soon become clear when we learn about the major scale.
We useoctave registers(C
4
, D
5
, etc.) to specify the exact register of
a note. The note C 4 is known as “middle C” and is an important reference
point. See the keyboard in the example below.

In treble clef, middle C is notated on the ledger line below the staff. In
bass clef, middle C is notated on the ledger line above the staff.

2.1 Half Steps and Whole Steps
A half step on a piano keyboard is the distance from one note to the next
nearest note. A whole step is made of two half steps.

2.2 The Major Scale
A major scale contains a specific succession of whole and half steps. It is helpful
to think of the pattern as consisting of two tetrachords. (Atetrachordis a
four–note scale segment.) The lower tetrachord consists of the pattern whole
step, whole step, half step. A whole step joins the lower tetrachord to the
upper tetrachord. The upper tetrachord duplicates the pattern in the lower
one: whole step, whole step, half step. If we use W for whole step and H for half
step, the major scale pattern is W–W–H, Whole–step connection, W–W–H.

Figure 2.2.2:The D major scale in treble clef
All major scales use the notes of the musical alphabet in order; no notes are
skipped and no notes occur twice. In the example above, the first four notes
are D–E–F
4
–G, not D–E–G
2
–G. In D–E–G
2
–G, G erroneously occurs twice
and the F

between E and G is skipped.
2.3 Major Key Signatures
A key signature is placed at the beginning of a piece (or the beginning of a
section) and is written with the clef on the beginning of each line of music.
Thekey signaturereminds the performer which sharps or flats are in the
scale (or key) of the piece and prevents the composer or arranger from writing
every sharp or flat from the scale every time it occurs.

2.3. MAJOR KEY SIGNATURES 7
There are 15 major key signatures. The key of C major has no sharps or
flats in the key signature. The other key signatures can have between 1 to 7
sharps and 1 to 7 flats, giving us the other 14 key signatures.

Figure 2.3.3:Major Key Signatures using Flats
It is important to memorize the order of sharps and flats, since you will be
writing key signatures regularly.
Theorder of sharpsis F–C–G–D–A–E–B, often remembered by a mnemonic.
One common mnemonic for the order of sharps is “Fast Cars Go Dangerously
Around Every Bend.”
Theorder of flatsis B–E–A–D–G–C–F. It is the reverse of the order of
sharps. It is easy to remember since the first four letters make the word BEAD,
and GCF is something most students learn as “Greatest Common Factor” when
studying math in elementary school.
A mnemonic that works forward and backward is “Father Charles Goes
Down And Ends Battle,” which reversed is “Battle Ends And Down Goes
Charles’ Father.”
A helpful learning device to remember the order of keys in relation to
the order of sharps and flats is thecircle of fifths. As you ascend in fifths
(clockwise), key signatures get one degree “sharper.” (C to G is a fifth because
C=1, D=2, E=3, F=4, and G=5.) As you descend in fifths (counterclockwise),
key signatures get one degree “flatter.”

2.3.1 Identifying Key Signatures
While it is preferable to memorize key signatures, use the following method
to determine major key signatures based on the sharps or flats in the key
signature.
1.For key signatures withs sharps: Go up a half–step from the last sharp
to find the key.
2.For key signatures with flats: The second–to–last flat is the key.

So far, we have looked at minor scales in relation to the major scale. How-
ever, we will typically encounter minor scales in music using minor key signa-

tures.
3.2 Minor Key Signatures
Minor key signatures agree with the notes of the natural minor scale. Since
the C natural minor scale had E
2
, A
2
, and B
2
, the key signature of C minor
has three flats, written in the order of flats—B
2
, E
2
, A

Therefore, a minor key signature will have three lowered notes—the 3rd,
6th, and 7th—in relation to the corresponding major key signature. We use
the termparallel minorwhen referring to a minor scale thathas the same
1st scale degree(in this case C) as the major. We say, “The parallel minor of
E major is E minor,” and “The parallel major of F minor is F major.” One
method of figuring out a minor key signature is to add three flats to the parallel
major key signature. This is the same as subtracting three sharps.

Note on uppercase versus lowercase: When writing below the five-line staff
to designate keys, we will use the shorthand of upper case for major (C) and
lowercase for minor (c). When writing prose, we will use uppercase: C major
and C minor.
We use the termrelative minorwhen referring to a minor key thathas the
same key signatureas a major key. For example, the relative minor of E
2
major
is C minor because both have three flats in the key signature. Conversely, one
could say the relative major of C minor is E
2
major. The relative major is
three half stepsabovethe relative minor.

Compositions in minor typically do not strictly use only one of the three

16 CHAPTER 3. MINOR SCALES AND KEY SIGNATURES
These names will be used throughout this text to refer to scale degrees,
chords built on these scale degrees, and keys associated with these scale degrees.
Another way to understand why some scale degrees have “sub-” in their
names is through the following example.

Basics of Rhythm

In relation to rhythm in music, we will discuss time signatures, durational
symbols, meter, beat, pulse, tempo.
4.1 Time Signature
In atime signature, the top number of the time signature tells you “how
many” and the bottom number tells you “of what.”

4.2 Durational Symbols
In the present day, the most common time signature is
4
4
(also known as
“common time”). It makes sense to introduce durational symbols in the context
of
4
4
because a whole note takes up a whole measure in
4
4
, a half note takes up
half a measure of
4
4
, a quarter note takes up
1
4
of a measure, and so on.

Two rare durational values are the double whole note (also called a “breve”)
and the 64th note, which is twice as fast as a 32nd note.

4.3 Dots and Ties
We have a whole note, which lasts for four beats, and a half note, which lasts
for two beats, but we don’t have a durational value that lasts three beats. To
do so requires using a dot or a tie.
Atielinks two notes together to create a new duration. Ties occur between
notes of the same pitch. Aslur, which looks like a tie, is placed over or under
notes of different pitches and means to play them in a connected manner.
Adotadded to a note increases the duration of that note by half. A
second dot represents half the value of the first dot, or a quarter of the original
duration. (These are known as “double–dotted notes.”)

4.4 Meter
Meterdescribes the number of beats in a measure (also know as a “bar”) and
how the beats are normally divided.
Beatis "[t]he basic pulse underlying measured music and thus the unit by
which musical time is reckoned..." according to Barry Kernfeld inThe New
Grove Dictionary of Jazz, 2nd edition.Pulseand beat are synonymous.
Temporefers to the speed of the beat or pulse. Tempo can be referred
to inbeats per minute(bpm), such as 60bpm (where the rate of the beat
would be equal to a second), or, in Classical music, with terms like Allegro,
Andante, and Adagio, sometimes in combinations with "M.M." forMaelzel’s
Metronome.
Meters with two beats in a bar are described asduple. If there are three
beats in a bar, the meter is described astriple, and if there are four beats in
a bar, the meter is described asquadruple.
If the beats are normally divided into two parts, the meter is described
assimple. If the beats are normally divided into three parts, the meter is
described ascompound.

When describing meter, we say how the beat is divided before the number
of beats in the measure.

4.5 Tuplets
Tupletis a generic term that describes a grouping of notes that would not
normally occur within a beat.
A quarter note naturally divides into two eighth notes or four sixteenth
notes. Atripletis a grouping of three eighth notes that occurs within the
span of the quarter note. Aquintupletwould be a grouping of five sixteenth
notes to occur within the span of one quarter note. It is not uncommon to see

4.6 Common Rhythmic Notation Errors
The standard practice when notating rhythms is to use beaming to show where
the beginning of each beat occurs.
Consider the following example:

erence point, matching the conductor’s beat pattern or your tapping toe.

The exception to this practice of “showing the beats” involves syncopation.
Syncopationoccurs when notes on weak beats and on weak parts of beats
are emphasized and nearby strong beats are deemphasized. Syncopation is
common in popular music.
Strong beats are the first beat of each measure (in
2
4
and
3
4
) and beats 1 and
3 in
4
4
. Syncopationat the beat levelinvolves ties across those strong beats.

Numbers in parentheses in the example below are beats that are obscured
through syncopation.

Syncopation can also occur at thedivision of the beatlevel. Below are two
syncopation figures that don’t show the beat but are acceptable because they
are common and to write them out correctly involves more symbols (beamed
eighths and ties) for the performer to comprehend.

Notice how syncopating notes gives them emphasis and creates a “pull”
against the rhythm of the accompaniment.
4.7 Practice Exercises
After listening to each example, specify the meter (e.g., “compound
triple”).
(a) Sousa, “Washington Post March”
(b) The Beatles, “Eleanor Rigby”
(c) Verdi, “La donna e mobile”
(d) Third Day, “Morning Has Broken”
(e) Latch featuring Sam Smith, “Disclosure”
26 CHAPTER 4. BASICS OF RHYTHM
For each example, specify the implied time signature and the meter (e.g.,
“simple duple”).

Intervals

5.1 Introduction to Intervals
Intervals are the building blocks of scales, chords (or harmonies), and melodies.
Intervalsare a measurement between two pitches, either vertically or hori-
zontally. When measuring vertically, we refer toharmonic intervalsbecause
the two notes sound simultaneously. When measuring horizontally, we refer to
melodic intervalsbecause the notes occur one after the other.

All intervals in the example above are either “perfect” or “major.”
5.1.1 Numeric Size of Interval
There are two elements to naming intervals: the quality and the number (for
example, “major sixth,” abbreviated as “M6”). Let us first focus on the numeric
size of intervals.
Odd–numbered intervals will always be a line to a line or a space to a space.

5.1.2 Interval Quality: Perfect versus Major/Minor
Intervals such as the unison, fourth, fifth, and octave can be classified as “per-
fect” but never “major” or “minor”. Conversely, the intervals of the second,
third, sixth, and seventh can bemajoror minor but never perfect in quality.
Perfect Intervals: Unison, 4th, 5th, 8ve
Major or Minor Intervals: 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th
Perfect intervals are always natural to natural, sharp to sharp, and flat to
flat except for the fourths and fifths between B and F, which involve B to F
4
and B
2
to F.

5.2 How to Identify Perfect, Major, and Minor Intervals
Here are two methods for identifying intervals.
The first method involves thinking of the lower note of an interval as the
tonic (the first note of the scale). Remember that all the notes above the tonic
in a major scale are perfect or major. Determine if the upper note is in the
major scale. If it is not, determine if the interval is a half step smaller than a
major interval, in which case it is a minor interval.

&

The second method is to memorize how many half steps there are in each
interval. To determine the size of an interval, count the number of half steps
between the two notes then refer to your memory.

* A “tritone” is a generic name for an augmented fourth (+4) or diminished
fifth (
◦
5). These two intervals are enharmonic. Augmented and Diminished
Intervals are discussed later in this chapter.

5.3 How to Write Perfect, Major, and Minor Intervals
To write an intervalabovea given note, use the two methods given below.
If you are asked to write a minor sixth above the note A, start with the A
major scale and key signature. In A major, there is an F
4
, which is a major
sixth above the note A. Therefore, F
6
is a minor sixth above A.

12
Alternatively, you can simply count the number of half steps. If you know
there are 8 half steps in a minor sixth, you can count from A up to F.
Writing small intervals up to a major thirdbelowa given note is straight-
forward using a combination of whole and half steps. However, to write larger
intervals below a given note, it is sometimes helpful to invert the interval first
(Inversion of Intervals Explained is discussed in the next section).
5.4 Inversion of Intervals Explained
There are only two notes in an interval, one lower and one higher. To invert
an interval, change the position of the notes so the note that was lower is now
higher.

represents “diminished” (one half step smaller than
perfect or minor) and the symbol+ represents “augmented” (one half step
larger than perfect or major).

anddiminished intervalsare one half stepsmallerthan perfect or minor
intervals.
Remember that perfect intervals (unisons, fourths, fifths, and octaves) can
never be major or minor, and major and minor intervals (seconds, thirds,
sixths, and sevenths) can never be perfect in quality. However, any size of
interval can be augmented or diminished.

Triads

6.1 Introduction to Triads
Atriadconsists of three notes stacked in consecutive thirds. A triad is also
called achordas well as aharmony. (Harmony also refers to chord progres-
sions.)
The lowest note of a triad when it is stacked in thirds is called theroot.
The middle note is the third and the highest note of the triad is the fifth. (We
will discuss inversions of triads later.)

Major and minor triads are common, diminished triads are less common,
and augmented triads are rare.
6.2 Lead–Sheet Symbols
Lead–sheet symbols(also known as “lead–sheet notation” and “lead–sheet
chord symbols”) are often used as shorthand for chords in popular music and
jazz. These symbols allow a guitarist or pianist to choose how to “voice” the
chords, i.e., how they want to arrange the notes.

Figure 6.2.1:Germanotta, Garibay, Blair, “Edge of Glory”
As you can see in the example above, major triads are represented by an
uppercase letter (A, E, and D) while minor triads are represented with the
root in uppercase followed by a lowercase “m” (e.g., F
4
m). Diminished triads
are represented by including the diminished symbol (
◦
) after the chord root
(e.g., C
◦
) while augmented triads are represented by including the augmented
symbol after the root (C+).
6.3. INVERTED TRIADS 37
6.3 Inverted Triads
Aninverted triaddoes not have the root as the lowest note. It is important
to distinguish betweenrootandbass. The root of a chord is the lowest note
when the notes are stacked in thirds. Thebassis the lowest note, which might
be the root, third, or fifth.
A triad is in “root position” when the root is the lowest note, “first inver-
sion” when the third of the chord is the lowest note, and “second inversion”
when the fifth of the chord is the lowest note.

6.3.1 "Slash" Chords
In lead–sheet notation, an inverted chord has the triad before the slash (/) and
the bass note after it. “ C/E” means a C triad with an E as the lowest note.
Therefore, aslash chordhas a bass note that is not the root of the chord. In
fact, it is possible to have slash chords where the bass note is not one of the
chord tones (e.g., C
/
F
4
).

6.4 Analyzing Chords
When a three–note chord is represented by four or more notes (some of which
are duplicates of the original three notes) and spread out across a grand staff,
38 CHAPTER 6. TRIADS
we can arrive at a lead–sheet symbol by answering three questions:
What is the root of the chord?
What is the quality of the chord (i.e., is the chord major, minor, dimin-
ished, or augmented)?
What is the bass note (i.e., is the chord inverted)?
To determine the root of the chord, write all the notes only on the lines of the
staff in treble clef (you may need to use ledger lines).

The bottom note is the root when the chord is stacked as a triad. In this
case, the root is D.
Next, determine the quality of the triad (major, minor, diminished, or
augmented) by analyzing if there is a M3 or m3 from the root to the 3rd, and
if there is a M3 or m3 from the 3rd to 5th.

Since there is a m3 (3 half steps) from D to F and a M3 (4 half steps) from
F to A, the triad is minor.
Finally, determine if the chord is inverted by checking to see if a note other
than the root is the lowest note. Since the bass note (lowest note) is the root
D, the chord is not inverted. The chord is in root position, so the lead–sheet
symbol is Dm.
Now, try the process again.

Since the lowest note is G, the chord is inverted. Our lead–sheet symbol is

6.5 Simple “Sus” Chords
Common in popular music are “sus” chords, with “sus” being a shortening of
“suspended,” a term we will study in the chapter on non–chord tones.
The two basic sus chords are the sus4 and sus2 chords. In thesus4chord
(also labeled simply as “sus”), a perfect 4th replaces the 3rd of the chord. In
thesus2chord (sometimes called “sus9”), a major 2nd replaces the 3rd of the
chord. Both of these sus chords have a perfect 5th from the root to the fifth.

Roman Numerals and Cadences

7.1 Roman Numeral Chord Symbols
Music is full of patterns that are similar from one piece to the next. As we
saw with minor scales, we were able to use scale degree numbers to show
the different patterns for harmonic, melodic, and natural minor, despite the
fact that there are 15 minor key signatures. Using numbers instead of note
names helps us see these patterns. Thinking of music in terms of numbers is
also helpful withtransposition, which means moving melodies and/or chord
progressions from one key to another. Thinking of music in terms of numbers
also helps us to analyze it and to spot similar patterns between many different
pieces in different keys.
We will use Roman numerals to represent chords within a specified key.
The Roman numeral “ I” represents a triad built on
ˆ
1 , or the 1st note of the
scale. Uppercase Roman numerals represent major triads and lowercase Roman
numerals (e.g., “ i”) represent minor triads. Uppercase Roman numerals with
a “+” are augmented (e.g., “ III+”), and lowercase Roman numerals with a
“
◦
” are diminished (e.g., “ vii
◦
”). (There is also the Nashville Number System,
which uses Arabic numbers for chords instead of Roman numerals.)

For inversion of Roman numerals, we will use a modified “slash chord”
notation until we study Figured Bass later on. For now, we will write “ I/3rd”
if the 3rd of the I chord is the bass note, for example.
&

C: I/3rd G: ii/5th

(C- E -G) is in the bass

7.3 Diatonic Chords in Minor
Because there are three versions of the minor scale, there are more than seven
diatonic chords in minor. The sixth and seventh scale degrees affect all of the
triads except the tonic, making 13 possible diatonic triads in minor.

Notice that both VII (the “subtonic triad”) and vii
◦
(the “leading–tone
triad”) are included. The subtonic triad (VII), built on the lowered
ˆ
7 that
occurs innaturalminor, regularly occurs in circle of fifth progressions in minor
and in rock and pop music, while the leading–tone triad (vii
◦
), built on raised
ˆ
7 , is usually either a passing harmony or has dominant function.
7.4 Cadences
We’ve been studying harmony—triads and chords. Acadenceis a harmonic
arrival point, a harmonic moment of stasis. A cadence can be compared to
a comma or period in written language—the ear gets a moment to process a
short passage of music, then the music continues. We will differentiate between
four basic cadences now, adding more specificity in a later chapter.
1.Authentic Cadence(AC): a phrase ending with the chords V–I
2.Plagal Cadence(PC): a phrase ending with the chords IV–I
3.Deceptive Cadence(DC): a phrase ending with the chords V–vi
4.Half Cadence(HC): a phrase ending on the V chord

In the example above, the notes surrounded by parentheses are non–chord
tones, which will be studied later. Also, there are seventh chords in this ex-
ample, which we will study in the next chapter.
Here is another example ending with an authentic cadence.

deceptive cadence
YT:ghjz6D34HPQ
Figure 7.4.8:Wagner,Tristan und Isolde, Prelude to Act I
A deceptive cadence means V did not go to I. This means that “ V to
not–I” is technically a more correct description for a deceptive cadence than
V–vi, which is the most common realization of “ V to not–I.”
In the example below, V goes to IV/3rd.

You may encounter chords with no thirds in rock and pop music. If you
encounter a chord that has only a root and fifth, label it with a “5” after the
root in lead sheet labeling (e.g., B
5
, as in the next example).
Additionally, you may encounterincomplete chords, which are chords
containing only the root and third but no fifth.

Seventh Chords

8.1 Introduction to Seventh Chords
Aseventh chordadds to a triad another note a third higher than the fifth.
Chords, being built in thirds, have members that are odd numbers—third, fifth,
seventh, and we will eventually discuss extensions of the ninth, eleventh, and
thirteenth. The fifteenth would be the double octave, so chords only extend as
high as the thirteenth.

In classical and popular music, there are five types of seventh chords com-
monly encountered:
the major seventh chord
the major-minor seventh chord (also known as a dominant seventh chord)
the minor seventh chord
the half-diminished seventh chord
the fully-diminished seventh chord (often called diminished seventh chord)

8.2 The IV/5 “sus” chord
An additional four-note chord that sounds like and functions similar to a V
7
chord is the IV/
ˆ
5 (or F/G in C major) chord. In popular music this chord
often is substituted for the V

8.3 Roman Numerals of Diatonic Seventh Chords
When notating seventh chords with Roman numerals, there are a few con-
ventions to follow. An uppercase Roman numeral means a major triad and
a lowercase Roman numeral means a minor triad. Adding “7” after a Roman
numeral means there is a minor seventh between the root and seventh of the
chord. Therefore, V
7
means a major triad with a minor seventh between the
root and seventh and vi
7
means a minor triad and a minor seventh between
the root and seventh. Add “M7” for a major seventh chord (e.g., IM
7
). The
half-diminished symbol (
ø 7
) means there is a diminished triad with a minor
seventh from root to seventh. The diminished symbol (
◦ 7
) on a seventh chord
means the triad is diminished and the distance from the root to seventh is a
diminished seventh.
Below are the diatonic seventh chords used in major and minor and their
Roman numerals.

Chapter 9

Harmonic Progression and Har-

monic Function

In this chapter we will look at common harmonic progressions and examine

the principle of harmonic function that underlies progressions.

9.1 The Circle of Fifths Progression
The circle of fifths progression (I–IV–vii

◦
–iii–vi–ii–V–I) was a stalwart of
the Baroque era in music. You will find many examples of this progression in

the music of Bach, Handel, and Vivaldi, especially in minor (i–iv–VII–III–VI–ii

◦
–V–i)
with the subtonic VII.

Figure 9.1.2:Handel, Suite in G minor, Passacaglia
This circle (the circle of fifthsfor harmonic progression) is different than
the circle of fifths for key signatures because this circle of fifths forharmonic
progressioncontains diatonic notes only. (The circle of fifths for key signatures
(Figure 2.3.4) contained all 12 notes of the chromatic scale.)

(bass and chords only)

Therefore, asequenceis a musical idea repeated at a different pitch level.
Sequences can be short or long. For example, look at this familiar idea and
notice how all four bars are sequenced down a step in the following four bars.

Figure 9.1.12: “I Love You Like A Love Song” bass line sequence in groups
of two notes
Sometimes we will hear a circle of fifths sequence where some of the chords
are not in root position, as in the Handel and Mozart examples. In these two
examples, we are hearing the sequence of the roots, even though they are not
clearly presented in the bass.

9.2 Harmonic Rhythm
You will find that all of the progressions we discuss can have different harmonic
rhythm.Harmonic rhythmis a term for how long each chord lasts. For ex-
9.3. SHORTER PROGRESSIONS FROM THE CIRCLE OF FIFTHS 65
ample, in “Fly Me To The Moon” (Figure 9.1.7), “I Will Survive” (Figure 9.1.8),
and “I Love You Like A Love Song” (Figure 9.1.9), each chord lasts for four
beats and has whole-note harmonic rhythm. In the Mozart (Figure 9.1.5) and
Wagner examples (Figure 9.1.6), on the other hand, each chord lasted for two
beats, and so had a faster harmonic rhythm.
Listen to the following example to hear four-beat harmonic rhythm change
to two-beat harmonic rhythm.

Figure 9.2.1:Bastille, “Pompeii”
In some music, harmonic rhythm will remain consistent, while in other
pieces there will be an infinite variety to the length of harmonies. Through-
out this text, we will be examining harmonic rhythm and the placement of
harmonies within the phrase.
9.3 Shorter Progressions from the Circle of Fifths
9.3.1 II-V-I
The “ ii–V–I” progression can be found in many pieces of music in all styles—classical,
popular, but especially jazz, since the Great American Songbook (popular
songs from the 1930s, 40’s, and 50’s) on which jazz repertoire is built contains
many examples of this progression.

This progression can occur in one of the following three ways (or orderings):
vi–ii–V–I
I–vi–ii–V
ii–V–I–vi
One can think of these reorderings as rotations, as shown in the example below.

9.3.2.3 ii-V-I-vi
Below is an example of the ii–V–I–vi progression. In this example, the vi
chord acts as a link between the V–I cadence in the middle of the phrase
and the ii chord at the beginning of the next phrase. This harmonic activity
after the arrival on the I chord is like a “turnaround” in jazz. We will discuss
turnarounds more in a later chapter on jazz harmony.

9.4 Harmonic Function
Now we will address non–circle–of–fifths progressions. Notice that we have not
included the vii
◦
or IV chord in any of the shorter circle of fifths progressions
above. However, it is a common axiom that Rock ‘n’ Roll is made up of
three chords: I, IV, and V. This is because each of those chords represents
a harmonic function. Harmonic functionrefers to the tendency of certain
chords to progress to other chords, or to remain at rest. Many texts on music
theory enumerate three harmonic functions. In this text, we will discuss four.
Tonic function (abbreviated “ton.”): The I chord has tonic function,
which is a state of stability and rest. Tonic chords do not demand pro-
gression to other chords.
Dominant function (abbreviated “dom.”): The V and vii
◦
(chords con-
taining the leading tone
ˆ
7 and supertonic
ˆ
2 ) tend to progress to tonic (I).
9.4. HARMONIC FUNCTION 73
Special note: The I/5th chord hasdominantfunction when it resolves
to the V chord, as in the third chord from the end of the “Star-Spangled
Banner.”

Pre–dominant function (abbreviated “pre–dom.”): The IV and ii (chords
containing the subdominant
ˆ
4 and submediant
ˆ
6 ) tend to progress to
chords of dominant function.
Tonic prolongation function (abbreviated “ton. prol.”): The vi and iii
(chords that share two common tones with
ˆ
1 –
ˆ
3 –
ˆ
5 from the tonic triad)
tend to occur after the tonic chord and progress to chords of pre-dominant
function.
Harmonic function is represented on a flowchart in the next section.

The tonic chord I can progress directly to a chord of any other function and,
in fact, many pieces begin with a I–V–I progression, representing harmonic
function of Tonic–Dominant–Tonic.
9.4.2 Tonic–Dominant–Tonic Progression
This is the most elemental progression in music, often realized with I–V–I.

Figure 9.4.8:S. Shafer and L. Shafer, “All My Ex’s Live in Texas”
The principle of “Tonic–Dominant–Tonic” could also be represented with
I–vii
◦
–I. Even though we learned that “dominant” means “
ˆ
5 ” (and also “ V”)
in earlier sections, “dominantfunction” in terms of harmony means “a chord
thatprogresses tothe tonic chord.” We will revisit this concept and other
possibilities for “dominant function” later.
9.4.3 Tonic–PreDominant–Dominant–Tonic Progression
This sequence of harmonic functions can be realized in four possible ways:
I–ii–V–I
I–IV–V–I
I–IV–vii
◦
–I
I–ii–vii
◦
–I
Here are examples with I–ii–V–I.

80 CHAPTER 9. HARMONIC PROGRESSION AND HARMONIC FUNCTION
Progressions using vii
◦
(I–IV–vii
◦
–I and I–ii–vii
◦
–I) are less common
because of the instability of diminished chords.
9.4.4 The Tonic–Tonic Prolongation–PreDominant–Dominant Progression
This progression is most commonly realized with I–vi–IV–V, although in
classical music one will often encounter I–vi–ii/3rd–V (mentioned above in
the section on vi–ii–V–I ).
Notice the bass line starts with descending thirds.

9.4.4.1 I–vi–IV–V
As mentioned earlier, the progression I–vi–IV–V was so prevalent in the
1950s that it is known as the “‘50’s progression” and the “50’s doo-wop pro-
9.5. EXCEPTIONS CREATED BY HARMONIC SEQUENCES 81
gression.”

and chords only)
You will see more examples of Tonic–Tonic Prolongation–PreDominant–Dominant
progressions, including the use of the iii chord, in the Practice Exercises and
the Homework.
Remember, there are two exceptions in Harmonic Function: IV has tonic
prolongation function when it progresses to I, and I/5th has dominant function
when it progresses to V.
9.5 Exceptions Created by Harmonic Sequences
Exceptions to the harmonic flowchart often can be explained by harmonic
sequences.

9.6 The Subtonic VII Chord in Popular Music
Although we will discuss mode mixture and the Mixolydian mode later, the
ubiquity of the subtonic chord (
2
VII) in rock and popular music makes it
important to discuss here.
The
2
VII chord can precede tonic, dominant, and pre-dominant chords,
which means it can substitute for any function except tonic.

chord in Major
Notice also that movement from IV–I (from the plagal cadence) is common
in the following examples from popular music.
Here are examples ending with
2
VII–IV–I, where IV progresses to I (a
plagal cadence) and is preceded by
2
VII.

Figure 9.6.2:Lennon–McCartney, “Hey Jude” (bass line and chords only)
Consider the following questions: When a phrase ends on the IV chord,
does it have dominant function (i.e, is it a half cadence)? Does IV have
84 CHAPTER 9. HARMONIC PROGRESSION AND HARMONIC FUNCTION
dominant function in popular music when it progresses to I? If so, does
2
VII
have pre–dominant function in the above progression?
Notice that
2
VII begins the phrase in the following example, and proceeds
to a IV–I conclusion.

Figure 9.7.1:The I–V–vi–IV “Best-Seller” Progression
The I–V–vi–IV progression occurs in many popular songs, has a Wikipedia
page, and has been mentioned in a New Yorker article about bestselling novels
(see the third paragraph from the end of the article). The music group Axis of
Awesome made a compilation of several songs with the I–V–vi–IV progres-
sion that makes for an entertaining summary (warning: there is some language
after the 5–minute mark).
Here is a written–out example that includes the I–V–vi–IV progression.

Chapter 10

Non–Chord Tones

10.1 Introduction to Non–Chord Tones
Non–chord tonesare notes that do not belong to the chord. Sometimes

referred to as “embellishing tones” and “non–harmonic tones,” non–chord tones

are classified by how they are approached and left (either by same tone, step,

or leap).

There are nine types of non–chord tones.
Non–Chord Tone Approached by Left by
Passing Tone step step in same direction
Neighbor Tone step step in opposite direction
Appoggiatura leap step
Escape Tone step leap in opposite direction
Double Neighbor see text see text
Anticipation step same note
Pedal Point same note same note
Suspension same note step down
Retardation same note step up
Table 10.1.1
The following qualifiers can be applied to non–chord tones:
Accented—occuring on the beat
Unaccented—occuring on the weak part of the beat (on the offbeat)
Chromatic—not belonging to the key
Metrical—equal to the duration of the beat
Sub–metrical—smaller than the beat
Super–metrical—larger than the beat
10.2 Passing Tones
Passing tones are notes that pass between chord tones.

Figure 10.2.1: Desrouleaux, Kirkpatrick, Martin, Robbins, Allan, “Want to
Want Me”
In the first bar of the “Want to Want Me” example, the passing tone is
unaccented. In the third bar, it is accented (on the beat). The non–chord tone
in bar 2 is an appoggiatura.
There can be two consecutive diatonic passing tones in a descending scale
segment from the root and fifth of a chord.

10.4 Appoggiatura
The appoggiatura is approached by leap and left by step. It is usually accented
(on the beat), which makes it a particularly expressive non–chord tone.

In the next section we discuss the escape tone.
10.5 Escape Tone
An escape tone is approached by step and left by leap in the opposite direction.
An easy example to remember is the end of the “Star–Spangled Banner.” The
word “of” in “homeofthe brave” is an escape tone.

The double neighbor is sometimes confused with escape tones and appog-
giaturas. Be sure to keep track of chord tones when analyzing non–chord tones.
Look at the next example and ask yourself how you would analyze the harmony
and non–chord tones on beat 4 of the first measure.

Figure 10.7.2:Harry and Moroder, “Call Me”
Sometimes syncopation will lead to an anticipation of a note in a chord in
the following measure, as occurs at the ends of bars 1, 2, and 3 of the “Call
Me” example.
10.8 Pedal Point
A pedal point is a note that is held through changing harmonies, starting as
a chord tone before becoming a non–chord tone. Pedal points are often in the
bass voice (the term “pedal” relates to the foot pedals on an organ).

Figure 10.8.2:Clara Schumann, Op. 13, No. 2, “Sie liebten sich beide”
The Clara Schumann example above also has a suspension (“3-2 sus.”);
suspensions are discussed in the next section.
When a pedal point is in the bass, it is not necessary to specify the inversion
of the chord because the bass pedal point obscures the inversion.
You might also encounter a pedal point in a higher voice, as well as a “double
pedal point,” where two notes (often a fifth apart) act as pedal points.

10.9 Suspension
Suspensions are accented non–chord tones occurring on downbeats. A suspen-
sion is approached by the same note and resolves down by step. A suspension
is made up of a preparation, suspension, and resolution. Sometimes the prepa-
ration is tied to the suspension.

The “ret.” in the tenor part in the second measure is a retardation, which
is covered in the next section.
10.10 Retardation
A retardation is usually an accented non–chord tone, meaning it occurs on a
downbeat. A retardation is approached by the same note and resolves up by
step.

Figure 10.10.1: Mozart, Piano Sonata in C major, K. 545, II
Classical composers like Mozart often used retardations and suspensions at
cadences in slow movements.
10.11 Incomplete Neighbor
Because composers are notorious for “breaking the rules,” you will encounter
examples in the real world that either defy explanation or have multiple valid
explanations. One “utility” non–chord tone is the incomplete neighbor.

You may also find incomplete double neighbor figures, especially in late
Romantic music and jazz. Keep an open mind when analyzing music.

10.12Adding Non–Chord Tones to a Chord Progression
Here are ideas for how to add non–chord tones (or “embellishments”) to the
melody or inner voice part of a chord progression:
Repeated note: add upper or lower neighbor
Step down:
(a) Add a suspension by delaying the resolution of the note
(b) Add an escape tone by moving by step in the opposite direction of
the original stepwise movement, then leap
(c) Add a double neighbor
(d) Add a chromatic passing tone
10.13. PRACTICE EXERCISES 107
(e) Add an anticipation
Step up:
(a) Add retardation by delaying resolution of the note
(b) Add a double neighbor
(c) Add a chromatic passing tone
(d) Add an anticipation
(e) Add an appoggiatura by leaping one step beyond the note of reso-
lution, placing the appogiatura on the beat, displacing the note of
resolution to occur after the beat
Leap of 3rd:
(a) Fill in the 3rd with a passing tone
(b) Add an appoggiatura by leaping one step beyond the note of reso-
lution, placing the appogiatura on the beat, displacing the note of
resolution to occur after the beat
Leaps of 4th or larger: do not embellish (for now)
Here is a basic framework with all possibilities labeled.

Notice that, when non–chord tones are added to different voices on the same
beat, consonant intervals (3rds, 5ths, 6ths, or 8ves) are made. If consonant
intervals can’t be made, the voices are staggered rhythmically (as occurs on
beats 3 and 4 in measure one of the example above).

Melodic Analysis

We will divide analysis of melodies into motives (which can be broken into
fragments) and phrases (which can be broken into subphrases) in order to
understand the construction of melodies. We will discuss periods and sentences
in another chapter.
11.1 Motive
Amotive(or motif) is the smallest identifiable melodic idea in music. How-
ever, we will find times when it will be necessary to discuss a smaller fragment
(called a “germ” by some authors) from a motive.
In the following example from the first movement of Beethoven’s Symphony
No. 1, we find four motives within the first four measures of the primary theme.

In the next section, we will look at some of the various ways one can alter a
melody
Figure 11.1.5:Beethoven, Symphony No. 1, I, development of motive 4
11.2 Melodic Alteration
While there are more than a dozen ways to alter a melody, we will focus on
seven methods of basic melodic alteration at this point of the text.
11.2.1 Inversion
Inversionas applied to a music means an idea is exactly upside-down or
“mirrored” across a horizontal plane, like mountains reflected in a lake.
First, listen to the following example.

Figure 11.2.2:Melodic inversion in Invention No. 1 in C Major by J.S. Bach
Melodic inversion can bereal(where every interval is exactly the same qual-
ity) ortonal(where the intervals abide by the scale or key). For the majority
of this text, we will encounter tonal inversion until we discuss techniques of
20th- and 21st-century music in the final chapters of this text.
11.2.2 Intervallic Change
Intervallic change is less exact than inversion. Withintervallic change, the
rhythm is generally intact and the motive relates to a previous iteration, but
some of the intervals are different.

We will discuss extension and fragmentation of motives later in this chapter.
Diminutionis the opposite of augmentation and usually refers to the
exact halving of the duration of every rhythmic value in a motive or phrase.
However, diminution can also refer to the use of shorter rhythmic values, as in
the following example.

11.2.5 Ornamentation
Ornamentationmeans the notes in a motive can be ornamented or embel-
lished with passing tones, neighbor tones, and the other non-chords tones we
studied in the previous chapter.
Here is an example of the ornamentation of a 4-note motive.

11.2.6 Extension
Extension of a motive needs little explanation: additional material is added to
the end of a motive upon its repetition or reoccurrence at a later point in a
piece.
Refer to the “Sir Duke” example directly above and to the final measure of
the J.S. Bach Invention in C Major example in the section on augmentation.
11.2.7 Retrograde
While rare in tonal music, it is worth mentioningretrograde, which is an
exact reversing of the order of notes, as can be seen in the following example
from popular music.

Figure 11.2.11: Melodic Retrograde in “Toxic” by Dennis, Karlsson,
Winnberg, Jonback
We will not consider transposition of a motive (also know as a sequence)
to be a motivic alteration worth labeling since it is so common.
11.3 Fragment
While the motive is usually defined as the smallest identifiable melodic idea in
a composition, “compound” motives can be broken intofragments(sometimes
called “germs”).
In J.S. Bach’s Invention 1 in C Major I, the opening 7-note compound
motive can be divided into two overlapping four-note fragments that can each
be developed independently.

11.4 Phrase
Musical form is full of sections, and thephraseis the smallest category of
section. Unlike a motive, a phrase gives the sense of completing a formal unit.
In classical music, phrases always end with cadences; if you have encoun-
tered a cadence, you have just witnessed the completion of a phrase. In popular
11.4. PHRASE 121
music, a phrase might be completed by a melody reaching four measures in
length or by completing a line of lyric instead of by a cadence.
To generalize (or perhaps over-generalize), most of the phrases you en-
counter will be four measures in length and will end with one of the four
cadence types (authentic cadence, half cadence, deceptive cadence, and, less
commonly, the plagal cadence). While four- and eight-measure phrases are the
most common, you will also encounter phrases that are five, six, and seven
measures in length. Less commonly, you will encounter three-measure phrases.
Here are examples of four-measure phrases. Notice that these phrases have
a sense of completion even though they do not end with cadences.

Here is an example of a five-measure phrase. Notice that the final chord
(a minor iv chord, which will be discussed in the chapter on mode mixture)
is part of a half cadence or deceptive cadence, yet the phrase has a feeling of
completion, especially considering its relation to the phrases before and after
it.

Examples of seven-measure phrases are rare and often involve elisions,
which will be covered in a later chapter when we discuss how phrases are
combined to create small forms like periods and phrase groups.
11.5 Subphrase
Subphrases are smaller than phrases but larger than motives. Most of the
subphrases we encounter will be two measures long. Subphrases are called
“phrase segments” and “phrase members” in other texts.
We will label subphrases with letters (a, b,etc.). When a subphrase repeats
but has slight alterations, we will put an apostrophe after the letter (e.g.,a’)
and refer to it as “a prime.” If another alteration to subphrase a occurs, we
will label it asa”and refer to it as “a double prime.” If the subphrase is merely
transposed (in a sequence), we will label it asa,nota’in our analysis.
We are including analysis of subphrases in this text because many compo-
sitions have melodic units that are two measures long. Analyzing subphrases
helps us understand the construction of melodies.
In the following example, notice that subphrasesaanda’have the same
first six notes (G

–F
4
–B–C
4
–E–E).

Notice that we are not looking at the motives within these subphrases. This
is because we are looking for melodic segments that are repeated. For some
compositions it is more informative to look at subphrases and less informative
to identify motives if motives are not extracted and developed.
There will be times when you will notice important melodic ideas happening
at three levels of analysis (motive, subphrase, and phrase), as in the following
example.

Figure 11.5.4:Noble, “The Very Thought of You”
When you listen to the music of “The Very Through of You” you will hear
that each motive lasts for two measures. The difference is that motives are
typically short—two to seven notes—whereas subphrases will usually contain
six or more notes and occupy two measures (half of a four-measure phrase).

Chapter 12

Form in Popular Music

The overall form of a piece of popular music usually can be broken down into

smaller 4–, 8–, 12–, or 16–bar sections. The material in this chapter is informed

by John Covach’s essay “Form in Rock Music” fromEngaging Music: Essays

in Music Analysis(ed. D. Stein).

12.1 Verse–Chorus Form
The Verse–Chorus formis arguably the most common musical form of

present day popular music and is probably familiar to most readers of this

text. In Verse–Chorus form, the chorus contains the “hook,” the memorable

refrain, while the verse typically contains less memorable melodic material. A

clear example can be found in the 1985 song “We Are the World.”

0:00–0:26 Introduction, 6 bars
0:26–0:53 Verse 1, 8 bars
0:53–1:18 Verse 2, 8 bars
1:18–1:49 Chorus, 9 bars
1:49–2:14 Verse 3, 8 bars
2:14–2:41 Chorus, 8 bars
2:41–3:08 Bridge, 8 bars
3:08–3:35 Chorus, 8 bars
3:35–4:02 Chorus, 8 bars ending with key change
4:02–end Chorus, 7 times in F major with fade out
Table 12.1.1:Jackson and Richie, “We Are The World”
YT:9AjkUyX0rVw
Common additions to the Verse–Chorus form, beside the bridge, are the
pre–chorus and post–chorus.

129
130 CHAPTER 12. FORM IN POPULAR MUSIC
0:00–0:25 Introduction, 12 bars
0:25–0:42 Verse 1, 8 bars
0:42–0:58 Pre–chorus, 8 bars
0:58–1:23 Chorus, 9 bars
1:23–1:31 Post–chorus, 4 bars
1:31–1:39 Interlude, 4 bars
1:39–1:56 Verse 2, 8 bars
1:56–2:12 Pre–chorus, 8 bars
2:12–2:37 Chorus, 12 bars
2:37–2:45 Post–chorus, 4 bars
2:45–3:02 Guitar solo, 8 bars
3:02–3:10 Interlude, 4 bars
3:10–3:26 Verse 3, 8 bars
3:26–3:42 Pre–chorus, 8 bars
3:42–4:37 Chorus, 21 bars
Table 12.1.2:Cobain, Novoselic, and Grohl, “Smells Like Teen Spirit”
YT:hTWKbfoikeg
It is worth noting that there may disagreement about labeling sections in
a form. One person may call a section a “pre–chorus,” another may call it a
“first chorus,” while another may call it “verse part b.” There is ambiguity in
naming sections and disagreement is to be expected.
There are “simple” and “contrasting” verse–chorus forms. Asimple verse–chorus
form has the same harmonic progression for the verse and chorus (e.g., “All
About That Bass”). The chord progressions for the verse and chorus are dif-
ferent in acontrasting verse–chorusform like “We Are the World.”
12.2 AABA Form
The AABA form is associated with the hits of the musicals of the 1930s and
remained one of the most popular forms of popular music until the 1950s, when
Rock ‘n’ Roll became popular. Each section (A or B) is typically 8 measures
long. The A sections contain the primary melody we associate with the song
while the B section provides contrast and is often called the “bridge” or “middle
eight.”
12.3. ABAC FORM 131

0:00–0:10 Introduction, 8 bars
0:10–0:18 A section (A1), 8 bars
0:18–0:26 A section (A2), 8 bars
0:26–0:35 B section, 8 bars
0:35–0:45 A section (A3), 10 bars
0:45–0:53 A section, 8 bars (instrumental shout chorus)
0:53–1:02 Introduction, 8 bars (shout chorus continues)
1:02–1:10 A section (A1), 8 bars
1:10–1:19 A section (A2), 8 bars
1:19–1:27 B section, 8 bars
1:27–1:35 A section (A3), 8 bars
1:35–1:54 Coda, 12 bars
Table 12.2.1:Gershwin, “I Got Rhythm”
YT:Q_jKTPsh54Y
It is common for one or more of the A sections to be instrumental, and it
is also common to eliminate an A section on the repeat of the entire AABA

form (AABAABA, for example).

Other well known songs with AABA form include Over the Rainbow from
The Wizard of Oz as well as many famous songs from theGreat American

Songbookby George Gershwin (“Let’s Call the Whole Thing Off,” “Someone

to Watch Over Me”), Cole Porter (“Anything Goes,” “Love for Sale,” “I Get

A Kick Out of You”), Irving Berlin (“Blue Skies,” “Puttin’ on the Ritz”), and

Jerome Kern (“The Way You Look Tonight,” “Smoke Gets In Your Eyes”).

The AABA form continued to be dominant into the 1960s (including Beatles
songs like “Yesterday,” “Norwegian Wood,” and “Hey Jude,” to name a few).

The AABA form is less common in the present day but can be found in songs

like The Cure’s “Friday, I’m in Love” (1992) and Norah Jones’s “Don’t Know

Why” (1999).

A note on terminology: the entire 32–bar AABA form is sometimes called
a “refrain” or “chorus,” and some AABA songs are preceded by a “verse.” This

means a song like “Someone To Watch Over Me” begins with a verse and is

followed by a “refrain” (which could also be called a “chorus”). Other synony-

mous terms you may encounter for “verse” in the context of AABA form are

“prelude” and “introduction.”

12.3 ABAC Form
Many popular songs from the 1930s–1950s were in the 32–bar ABAC form.

Well–known examples include “White Christmas,” “Someday My Prince Will

Come,” and “When I Fall In Love.”

“Star Dust” is an example of an ABAC form that is usually performed with
a verse preceding the refrain.

132 CHAPTER 12. FORM IN POPULAR MUSIC
0:00–0:13 Introduction, 4 bars
0:13–1:13 Verse, 16 bars (8 bars + 8 bars)

2:57–3:12 Coda, 4 bars
Table 12.3.1:Carmichael, “Star Dust”

The ABAC form may also occur as ABAB’ where the B’ section begins the
same as the B section but ends differently.
12.4 The 12–Bar Blues
Associated with the Blues genre, which originated in the early 1900s, the
12–bar blues was also popular during the Swing Era of the 1930s and 1940s,
(examples include “In The Mood” and “One O’Clock Jump”), as well as during
the early years of Rock ‘n’ Roll in the 1950s (“Johnny B. Goode,” “Hound Dog,”
“Rock around the Clock”). The basic 12–bar blues progression is shown below.
Bars 1–4: I I I I
Bars 5–8: IV IV I I
Bars 9–12: V IV I I
Table 12.4.1:Berry, “Johnny B. Goode”
YT:ZFo8-JqzSCM
12.5 Harmonically Closed and Open Sections
A harmonically closed section ends on the tonic chord (I). A harmonically
open section typically ends on a non–tonic chord like V, but could also end
on IV.
In an AABA form, the A sections are usually harmonically closed, ending
on I, and the B section (or bridge) is usually harmonically open, ending on V.
In verse–chorus form, sections that leads into the chorus (verse, pre–chorus,
12.6. PRACTICE EXERCISES 133
and bridge) are usually harmonically open, while choruses can be harmonically
closed or open.
If you compose a piece in AABA or verse–chorus form, placing harmonically
open and closed sections appropriately is important to the flow of the music.
For example, the verse and bridge on “We Are the World” are harmonically
open (end on V) while the chorus is harmonically closed (ends on the tonic
chord, I).
13.9 Practice Exercises
For each song, fill in the beginning time for each section, label each section
type (verse, pre–chorus, chorus, post–chorus, interlude, introduction, A,
B, or C section, etc.), and the number of bars in each section of the form.

13.8 Summary of Phrases in Combination
13.1 The Perfect Authentic Cadence
We will now distinguish between two types of authentic (V–I) cadences: the
Perfect Authentic Cadence (PAC) and the Imperfect Authentic Cadence (IAC).
ThePerfect Authentic Cadencemust meet three requirements:
V–I
Both chords in root position
Tonic scale degree (
ˆ
1 ) in the highest voice of the tonic chord

occurs in place of V),
the cadence is anImperfect Authentic Cadence(IAC).
13.2 The Sentence
Asentencein musicis a phrasewith a specific melodic construction: a melodic
idea (motive 1 or subphrase a) is either repeated or sequenced then followed
by either related or unrelated material leading to a cadence.
In this first example, Mozart sequences motive 1 from measure 1 up a step
in measure 2. Measure 3 contains related material and measure 4 contains
cadential material.

sures 3–4 to fit the dominant harmony. He extracts motive 2 from subphrases
a and a’ in measures 5–6. Measures 7–8 lead to a half cadence.

13.3 The Period
In music, aperiodconsists of at least two phrases with the final phrase ending
in a more conclusive cadence than the first phrase.
13.3.1 Conclusiveness of Cadence
Because period form involves “more conclusive” and “less conclusive” cadences,
it is important to distinguish between inconclusive and conclusive cadences.
Conclusive cadences end on the tonic chord, while inconclusive cadences do
not.
138 CHAPTER 13. PHRASES IN COMBINATION
Inconclusive Cadences Conclusive Cadences
Deceptive Cadence (V–vi) Authentic Cadence (V–I)
Half Cadence (ends on V) Plagal Cadence (IV–I)
In addition, the perfect authentic cadence (PAC) is more conclusive than
the imperfect authentic cadence (IAC). While the plagal cadence (PC) occurs
less frequently than the other three cadences listed in the table above, it will
sometimes occur in root position at the end of a phrase after an inverted
imperfect authentic cadence (IAC) has concluded a previous phrase, with the
understanding that a root position PC could be considered more conclusive
than an inverted IAC.
Generally, a period will either contain a phrase ending in a half cadence
(HC) followed by a phrase ending in an authentic cadence (IAC or PAC), or
it will contain a phrase ending in an IAC following by a phrase ending in a
PAC.
13.3.2 Examples of the “Less Conclusive–More Conclusive” Cadential Formula
In the first example, a HC concludes the first phrase and a PAC concludes the
second phrase, making a period.

13.3.3 Antecedents and Consequents
In a period, the phrase ending with the less conclusive cadence is called the
“antecedent” and the phrase ending with the more conclusive cadence is called
the “consequent.” These can be thought of as being in a “question and answer”
relationship.

13.3.4 Parallel and Contrasting Periods
Periods are labeled as “parallel” or “contrasting” based on the melodic material.
In aparallel period, the melodies in both phrases begin similarly. In a
contrasting period, the phrases begin differently.
The three preceding examples are parallel periods
The apostrophe mark (’) is called “prime” and is used to show a phrase is
similar to a previous phrase but ends with a different cadence. Therefore a’ is
called “a prime” and a” is called “a double prime.” If you are analyzing a piece
142 CHAPTER 13. PHRASES IN COMBINATION
that requires triple and quadruple primes, it is clearer to use a
1
, a
2
, a
3
, and
so on.
Below is an example of a contrasting period.

In following two sections, we will examine periods containing more than
two phrases.
13.4 The Asymmetrical Period
Asymmetrical periods consist of three or five phrases. In an asymmetrical
period, there will be an unequal number of antecedents and consequents, hence
the “asymmetry.” In the example below, there is one antecedent and two
consequents.

13.5. THE DOUBLE PERIOD 145

13.5 The Double Period
The Double Period.Adouble periodconsists of at least 4 phrases and is

comprised of anantecedent groupand aconsequent group. The first two

phrases in a double period are the antecedent group and the final two phrases

are the consequent group, which ends with a cadence that “answers” the less

conclusive cadence (or “question”) that ended the antecedent group.

The melodic scheme ofabab’(four phrases) is commonly encountered in a
double period. A double period with this melodic scheme would be described as

a “paralleldouble period” because both the antecedent group and consequent

group begin with the same melody.

Figure 13.5.3:Possible cadential schemes in a double period
Notice that the first two phrases of an antecedent group can consist of
an IAC followed by a HC (“Scheme 3” in the above example). This may seem
confusing if you are focused on analyzing phrases solely in groups of two instead
considering how many phrases are in a section before analyzing the cadential
scheme and the form.
13.5.1 Repeated Period
You may encounter a section consisting of four phrases that is not a double
period but instead is arepeated period.

13.6 Phrase Groups and Phrase Chains
Phrase groups and phrase chains are not periods. In phrase groups and phrase
chains,the final cadence is a half cadence. Aphrase groupconsists of at least
two phrases whose melodies begin similarly and has the final phrase ending in
a half cadence. The terminology in this section draws from Douglass Green’s
Form in Tonal Music.

13.9. PRACTICE EXERCISES 155
16.6 Practice Exercises
For each excerpt below, do the following:
Label chords with Roman numerals at the ends of phrases to deter-
mine cadences
Label cadences by type (PAC, IAC, HC, PC, DC)
Examine the motivic structure to determine if a phrase is a sentence
Create a diagram of the form using cadence abbreviations (HC, DC,
PC, IAC, and PAC) and letters to designate melody (a,a’,b, etc.).
Use the “prime” symbol (’) to show if a melody ends with a dif-
ferent cadence. In this chapter, the prime symbol should not be
used to represent embellishment of the melody or changes in the

Chapter 14

Accompanimental Textures

In this chapter we will focus on common accompanimental textures. This
chapter does not make an attempt to catalog every known accompanimental
texture. Instead, it is meant to encourage you to listen to texture more closely
and increase your musical awareness.
14.1 Texture
We will considertexturein terms of vertical and horizontal elements. The
vertical nature of texture relates to the number of notes occurring simultane-
ously as harmonies. It could also relate to the number of voices or instruments
performing melodies simultaneously in a contrapuntal texture. The horizontal
element of texture relates to rhythmic activity: is the most common rhythmic
value in a passage a slow or fast one?
To illustrate, here is a texture with chords (vertical elements) containing
five voices with a melody (a sixth voice) above. Notice that the texture has
slow rhythmic values on the horizontal plane.

Figure 14.1.1:Barber,Adagio for Strings
Our second example is an excerpt for four instruments—a string quartet.
While this a four-voice texture, it is full of rhythmic activity. The most common
rhythmic value is the sixteenth note, and the syncopated figures in measures

3–4 of the Violin I part and measures 5–6 of the Viola part add to the textural
complexity.

Figure 14.1.2:Mozart, String Quartet K. 428, IV
In the following sections, we will examine fairly straightforward melody-
and-accompaniment textures in classical and popular music. In later chapters
we will explore more complex textures.
14.2 Chorale Texture
Chorale textures are those in which there is a chord for every (or nearly every)
melody note. A familiar example of chorale texture is the “Star–Spangled
Banner.”

Chorale textures are also described as “homorhythmic” because all of the
parts move in the same rhythm.

One way to express chords rhythmically is through arpeggios in one part
and a bass line in octaves in a lower part, as in the following example from
Beethoven’sMoonlight Sonata.

Figure 14.3.2:Keys, “If I Ain’t Got You”
Notice that in both the Beethoven and Alicia Keys examples there is the
harmonious interval of a tenth (an octave plus a third) between the bass (low-
est) voice and the soprano (highest) voice.
The following examples have arpeggios that ascend and descend through a
chord.

14.4.2 The “Barbara Ann” Rhythm

are six examples of pieces that use this rhythm, whether with block chords or
solely in the bass line.

14.5.2 Offbeats
Offbeatsare typically chords that occur regularly on upbeats, avoiding down-
beats. While there are many styles of music that use chordal offbeats, in this
section we will consider only polka and reggae styles.
14.5.2.1 Polka
The polka, which originated in Bohemia, has connotations with Germary and
Oktoberfest. The polka in the United States is often associated with Frankie
Yankovic, who was known as the “Polka King.”

14.6. THE 3–2 CLAVÉ 181
14.6 The 3–2 Clavé
The 3–2 clavé (and the 2–3 clavé) are essential rhythmic elements in Afro-
Cuban music. In this section we will see how cross rhythms implied by the 3–2
clavé can be viewed as a possible source of cross rhythms in popular music.
Here is a video demonstration of a 3–2 clavé.

Here is rhythmic notation of a 3–2 clavé. Notice there are three attacks in
the first measure and 2 attacks in the second bar.

which is a short repeated pattern). Listen to the distinctive bass lines in the
following examples.

This chapter is meant to give you ideas about animating chords and chord
progressions with accompanimental textures, including riffs. It is by no means

meant to be exhaustive, but rather to encourage you to listen closely to texture

and accompaniment.

Chapter 15

Creating Contrast Between Sec-

tions

In this chapter, we will explore how a composer or arranger can create contrast

between different sections in a piece of music.

15.1 The Elements of Music
Creating contrast usually involves varying one or more of the “Elements of

Music,” which are listed and explained below.

Melody
We all know what melody is, but don’t confuse
melody with ostinato! Melody lives and breathes
and has variety.
Harmony
In this section, we will associate harmony with
key and mode (major versus minor).
Rhythm
What the most common rhythmic value is in a
section.
Timbre
The different tone colors of different instruments,
and the different tone colors an individual
instrument can produce.
Texture
Described in the previous chapter as existing in
the vertical plane (the number of voices) and the
horizontal plane (rhythmic activity of the various
voices).
Articulation
Staccato versus legato, or short, clipped notes
versus long, sustained or connected notes.
Dynamics
Loud versus soft.
Register
High versus middle versus low.
Table 15.1.1:The “Elements of Music”
195
196 CHAPTER 15. CREATING CONTRAST BETWEEN SECTIONS
In the next two sections we will look at how two different pieces exhibit
contrast between various sections using the elements of music.
15.2 Mozart,Eine kleine Nachtmusik, K. 525, II.
The second movement of Mozart’sEine kleine Nachtmusikis a five–part rondo
form (ABACA).
Let us examine the elements of music in the first section (the A section).

The following elements are noticeably changed:
Harmony
This section begins in C minor
Rhythm
The accompaniment moves in 16th notes and the
ornamentation of the second melody note (the
turn) in the outer parts sounds as four 32nd notes
Texture
The middle two parts (Violin II and Viola) are
paired together and the Violin I and Cello/Bass
part engage in imitation
Articulation
The middle parts are played in a “separated”
manner (more staccato than legato) and the
motive in the outer voices starts with a staccato
note
Table 15.2.6:C Section, Second Movement,Eine kleine Nachtmusik
Listen to how Mozart puts the entire form together, including transitional
material to smooth out the changes from one section to another.

In Verse 1 there is no bass drum, snare drum, or electric bass. All we
hear are the voice part and the two guitar parts from the top two staves in
the example above. There are fewer voices occurring on the vertical plane,
creating a light texture.

Figure 15.3.1:Verse 1 of “Rude”
The bass guitar and drum groove enter in Verse 2, thickening the texture
and adding the backbeat of the snare drum.

Figure 15.3.2:Verse 2 of “Rude”
In the pre–chorus, the guitars and bass have legato half notes and quarter
notes while the drummer plays cross–stick eighth notes (if one is counting in a

). Without the snare drum backbeat, the texture lightens.
YT:PIh2xe4jnpk
Figure 15.3.3:Pre–Chorus of “Rude”
The chorus has approximately the same accompaniment as Verse 2 but the
voice parts are in a higher register, repeating a 2–measure subphrase containing
the “hook.”

Figure 15.3.4:Chorus of “Rude”
The post–chorus emphasizes a (3+3+2)+(3+3+2) rhythm on all instru-
ments (guitars, bass, and the bass drum, snare drum, and hi–hat of the drum
set).

This five–section unit repeats again with Verse 3, Verse 4, the Pre–Chorus,
Chorus, and Post–Chorus.
When you listen to the entire piece, you hear how the musicians designate
the form using the elements of articulation, rhythm, texture, and dynamics.
One element that changes very little during entire song is the chord progression,
which we examined in the chapter on harmonic progression.

While you are likely aware of successful songs in the which very few musical
elements change, it is worth considering how you can articulate the form of your
compositions and arrangements using the elements of music.

Figured Bass

16.1 Historical Context
In the Baroque era in music (roughly 1600–1750 C.E.), a shorthand was devel-

oped for writing chords. (Lead–sheet symbols are the modern shorthand for

representing chords). Figured bass(also known asthoroughbass) consists

of a bass line notated on a staff accompanied by numbers representing intervals

to be played above the bass note within the key signature. (These figured–bass

numbers are traditionally notated below the bass line.)

minor, HWV 362, I. Larghetto

Figure 16.1.3:Handel, Recorder Sonata in A minor, HWV 362, I. Larghetto,
with figured bass realization
Like lead–sheet symbols, figured bass allowed a keyboardist or guitarist
freedom in choosing chord voicings. While some early music specialists perform
from scores with the original notation, editions of Baroque compositions by
composers like J.S. Bach and Handel that were originally notated with figured
bass have been “realized” or written out in modern editions.
In the present day, figured bass is taught in music theory courses primarily
as a shorthand for chord inversion symbols (although many music programs
also endeavor to teach students to perform at the piano music written with
figured bass notation).
16.2 Figured Bass Inversion Symbols
Following are the figured bass inversion symbols most commonly used for triads
and seventh chords. (Remember that figured bass numbers represent intervals
above the bass note within the key signature.)
16.2. FIGURED BASS INVERSION SYMBOLS 205
Figured Bass
(or "Bass Position Symbols", or "bps")
For Triads:

3rd of the triad
is the bass note.
5th of the triad
is the bass note.
For Seventh Chords:
7 6 5 4 3 4 2
Root of the seventh chord
is the bass note.
The 3rd of the seventh chord
is the bass note.
The 5th of the seventh chord
is the bass note.
The 7th of the seventh chord
is the bass note.

Figure 16.2.2:Figured Bass Inversion Symbols for Seventh Chords
Unlike original figured bass notation in the Baroque era, in music theory
courses, figured bass inversion symbols are placed after Roman numerals.
Compare figured bass symbols to the modified slash notation we have been
using in previous chapters.

16.3 The Cadential Six–Four Chord
A common term in music theory—the “cadential six–four” (or cadential
6
4
)—is used to refer to the I
6
4
that regularly proceeds the V chord in cadences.

Figure 16.3.2: Francis Scott Key and John Stafford Smith, “The Star–-
Spangled Banner”
It is worth remembering that the cadential
6
4
(or I
6
4
) has dominant function,
just like the V chord that usually follows it. Previously, we have called this
chord “ I/5th.”
We will use the term “cadential six–four” throughout the rest of this text,
now that figured bass has been introduced.
16.4 Other Occurrences of Six–Four Chords
Second–inversion chords with the fifth of the chord in the bass, also known as
6
4
chords, are special chords found only in four situations in Classical music.
Cadential six–four (discussed in the previous section)
Passing six–four: the bass line will look like a passing–tone figure, with
three stepwise ascending or descending notes, and the middle chord will
be a
6
4
chord

Melodic bass six–four: in this situation, the bass voice has the melody;
when the fifth of the chord occurs in this bass voice melody, the result
will be a
6

chord.
16.5 Additional Information
Though we will not use them in our harmonic analyses, you will sometimes
encounter figured bass symbols containing all of the intervals above the bass
note in Baroque music containing figured bass. The common figured bass
inversion symbols in the sections above are abbreviations of the figures given
in the examples below.

18.1 Secondary Diminished Chords
So far we have studied diatonic harmony (chords without accidentals, with the
exception of the use of raised
ˆ
6 and
ˆ
7 in minor, which are considered diatonic).
In the following chapters, we will studychromaticharmony.
17.1 Examples with Secondary Dominants
Secondary dominants are common in classical and popular music. Here are
examples with the chromatic chords noted. We will examine these chords
more closely later in the chapter.

17.2 Tonicization
In this chapter and the next, we will studytonicization, which means treating
a chordotherthan the I chord like a tonic by approaching it with its dominant.
In diatonic harmony, the V chord (the dominant) resolves to the I chord (the
tonic). Asecondarydominant is a major triad or dominant seventh chord that
resolves to (ortonicizes) a chord other than the I chord.

Figure 17.2.1
Sing the bass line of the example above and notice that a secondary chord,
through its chromaticism, intensifies the drive to the next chord.
Principle 17.2.2 Secondary Dominants. The Roman numeral after the
slash is the chord being tonicized by the V chord before the slash.
You may find that you want to analyze the D

in the example above as
a II
6
5
instead of a V
6
5
/
V (which we pronounce as “ V

of V”), and the E
7
/
G
4
as a III
6
5
instead of V
6
5
/
vi (“ V
6
5
of vi”). Notice, however, that a ii chord is
typically minor in a major key and diminished in a minor key (ii
◦
), making
uppercase II a chromatic harmony for which the proper label is V/V.

While labeling D

as II
7
in C major makes the root clear, it does not
communicate the function of the D
7
, which is to progress to a G major chord
(the V chord, or the dominant in C major).
Also, notice that the vii
◦
is not tonicized with its secondary dominant
in the example above. Listen to the following example to understand why
diminished chords such as vii
◦
and ii
◦
in minor are not tonicized.

Figure 17.3.2:Secondary Dominant Seventh Chords in Major
Notice the chromaticisms in the example above. The raised notes generally
act as the leading–tone to the root of the chord being tonicized. In the major
mode, the only secondary dominant with a lowered chromaticism is V
7
/
IV.
The lowered note in V
7
/
IV acts as
ˆ
4 of the chord being tonicized in the same
way the last flat of a key signature is
ˆ
4.
Below are all secondary dominant chords (triads and major-minor seventh
chords) in the minor mode.

Figure 17.3.4:Secondary Dominant Seventh Chords in Minor
Remember that both vii
◦
(on raised
ˆ
7 ) and the subtonic VII (on the
lowered
ˆ
7 ) occur in the minor mode. The subtonic VII can be tonicized with
17.4. ANALYZING SECONDARY DOMINANTS 217
V
7
/
VII, while vii
◦
, being diminished, cannot.
Notice that an F major chord in C minor can be V/VII or IV, depending
on how it functions or progresses. If the F major chord progresses to a B
2
chord, label the F chord as V/VII. If the F major chord has pre–dominant
function and progresses to a G major chord (in any inversion) or B
◦
, label the
F chord as IV.
The B
2
7
chord, on the other hand, can be labeled correctly as V
7
/
VII or
VII
7
because both V
7
/
VII or VII
7
progress to III in minor.
17.4 Analyzing Secondary Dominants
When you encounter a chord with a chromaticism and suspect it is a secondary
dominant, use the following process.
Stack the chord in thirds to determine the root and quality. If the chord
quality is major (if a triad) or a major–minor seventh chord, go on to
step 2. If the chord quality is not major or major–minor seventh, the
chord is not a secondary dominant.

17.6 Irregular Resolutions of Secondary Chords
The roots of secondary dominants do not always resolve down a perfect fifth to
the tonicized chord. In many of the examples of popular music with secondary
dominants at the beginning of this chapter, the secondary dominants resolve
deceptively.

Figure 17.6.1:Paul McCartney, “Yesterday” (1965)
In “Yesterday,” the V/V resolves not to V but to IV, which sometimes
acts as a substitute for the V chord (the dominant) in popular music.
This progression also happens in “Forget You,” where a V
7
/
V resolves to
a IV chord.

Figure 17.6.3:Rick Nielson, “I Want You to Want Me” (1977)
Remember, however, that the subtonic
2
VII in major can act as a substitute
for the dominant (see the Harmonic Flowchart for Popular Music with Subtonic
VII chord in Major).
In “Baby Love” by the Supremes, a C
7
/
B
2
in C major (V
4
2
/
IV) resolves to
an A
7
chord (V
7
/
ii), which then resolves to ii (Dm). In this example, notice
that the B
2
in the C
7
/
B
2
is a lowered chromatic note that wants to resolve
downward by half step to A. Instead of this A being the third of the IV chord
(an F major chord), which is the traditional and expected resolution, it is the
root of an A
7
chord (V
7
/
ii).

Finally, a rather common deceptive resolution of a secondary dominant is
V

vi to IV, which can be seen in the following three examples.

Figure 17.6.7:Beethoven, Piano Sonata Op. 53, I (1804)
There are two ways to conceptualize this progression. The first is that the
progression of iii to IV (Em to F in C major) is not unusual, so E to F, which
appears to be III to IV but is in fact V/vi to IV, is a chromatic modification
of iii to IV. The other way to think of V/vi to IV is as V/vi to VI/vi, a
deceptive progression within the submediant area.
We can conclude that secondary chords do not always resolve strictly to
the chords they appear to be tonicizing.

18.3 Analyzing Secondary Diminished Chords
18.4 Writing Secondary Diminished Chords
The vii
◦
chord has dominant function (see the Harmonic Function Flowchart).
Since chords of dominant function typically resolve to chords of tonic func-
tion, diminished triads as well as half–diminished and fully–diminished seventh
chords occur as secondary diminished chords.

Figure 18.1.1:A Harmonic Sequence with Secondary Diminished Chords in
C major
Below are some examples of pieces with secondary diminished chords. No-
tice that chromaticism is an “essential” part of secondary diminished chords
(“non–essential” chromaticism refers to chromatic non–chord tones).

Figure 18.2.2:Secondary Diminished Triads and Seventh Chords in Minor
Notice that vii
◦
/III in minor is not included because it is ii
◦
. Notice

also that vii
ø 7
/
III has no accidentals—it is the same as ii
ø 7
but functions
228 CHAPTER 18. SECONDARY DIMINISHED CHORDS
differently. The ii
ø 7
chord has pre–dominant function and progresses to V
whereas the vii
ø 7
/
III chord progresses to III.
Minor triads are tonicized by fully diminished seventh chords. Major triads
are traditionally tonicized by half diminished seventh chords but can also be
tonicized by fully diminished seventh chords.
18.3 Analyzing Secondary Diminished Chords
When you encounter a chord with a chromaticism and suspect it is a secondary
diminished seventh chord, use the following process.
Stack the chord in thirds to determine the root and quality. If the chord
quality is a diminished triad or a half–diminished and fully–diminished
seventh chord, go on to step 2. If the chord quality is not a diminished
triad or a half–diminished and fully–diminished seventh chord, the chord
is not a secondary diminished chord.

inversion.
Determine the note that would be aminor 2nd above the root of the
chord you are analyzing. If this note of resolution would be the root of
a diatonic chord, the chord you are analyzing is a secondary diminished
chord.

18.4 Writing Secondary Diminished Chords
To write a secondary diminished chord, use the following procedure.
First determine the note that is the root of the chord being tonicized (the
chord to the right of the slash).

19.1 Mode Mixture
19.1 Mode Mixture
Mode mixturetypically consists of borrowing chords from the parallel minor
during a passage in a major key. “Borrowed chords” refers to borrowing
chords from minor and is synonymous with mode mixture. In the examples
that follow, notice the lowered chromaticisms—
2 ˆ
6 is most common but
2 ˆ
3 and
2 ˆ
7 also occur in borrowed chords.

Figure 19.1.1:Lennon–McCartney, “Blackbird” (1968)
Notice the emotional effect of switching to the minor mode.
A famous example that progresses from the major I chord immediately to
the minor i chord is Richard Strauss’sAlso Sprach Zarathustra.

Figure 19.1.8:Kurt Cobain, “Lithium” (1992)
In the example above for “Lithium,” the Roman numerals are analyzed as
triads instead of “5” chords because the third of the chord is either implied or
occurs in the voice part (not shown).
In the next example from the third movement Brahms’s Third Symphony,
the I chord alternates twice with a borrowed chord. The movement began in
C minor, so there are three flats in the key signature, but this section is in C
major.

It is not necessary to memorize the chords in this section so much as to
realize that the quality of diatonic chords will be altered when a scale degree
from the minor mode is included in the chord.
19.3 Analyzing and Writing Borrowed Chords
Unlike secondary chords, you merely note the root, quality, and inversion of a
borrowed chord in your Roman numeral analysis.
So, for the following chord:

Notice that the root is A when you stack the notes in 3rds, and A is
ˆ
2 in
G major. The quality is half–diminished since the 3rds stack as m3–m3–M3,
making this a ii
ø 7
chord. Since C, the 3rd of the chord, is in the bass, the
correct analysis is ii
ø 6
5
.
To write a borrowed chord from a Roman numeral, be sure topay close
attention to the quality of the Roman numeral.
A:

VI is built on

2 ˆ
6 in A major, which is F

, then stack 3rds
in the configuration M3–m3. The resulting triad contains F

–A–C

.

Be careful of flats before Roman numerals. Flats mean to lower a root a
m2in the key signature,notto literally put a flat in front of the root of a
chord.
19.4 The Deceptive Cadence with

VI
The V–
2
VI deceptive cadence is a deceptive realization of a deceptive progres-
sion. This V–
2
VI cadence ties into the
2
VI–
2
VII–I progression to produce an
“epic” (although somewhat clichéd) ending to the “Star Spangled Banner” as

Whitney Houston, Beyoncé, and Lady Gaga, among others.

19.5 The Picardy 3rd
It is rare to borrow from the major mode during a passage in a minor key. The
major tonic usually functions as V/iv if it’s not the last chord of a piece, and
raised
ˆ
6 and
ˆ
7 occur naturally as part of the melodic minor scale.
In minor, the one place to borrow from the major mode is at the end of a
piece in minor, with the use of the major I chord instead of minor i.

While the Picardy 3rd (the major third above the tonic) was most com-
monly encountered in the Baroque era, it has been used from then until now,
though with less frequency.

The Neapolitan Chord

20.1 The Neapolitan Chord

The label “Neapolitan” is used in classical music for the
2
II chord and is

labeled as “ N” instead of
2
II. For example, when the Neapolitan chord occurs

in first inversion—its most common inversion—it is labeled as N

6
.
Being a chromatically altered ii chord, the Neapolitan has pre–dominant
harmonic function.

Notice the special character of the Neapolitan and how composers some-
times alter texture, register, and dynamics when the Neapolitan occurs, as in

the first movement of Beethoven’s Symphony No. 7, Op. 92.

21.1 Augmented Sixth Chords
21.2 Types of Augmented Sixth Chords
Augmented sixth chordsare a special class of pre–dominant chords with

notes that approach the dominant (
ˆ
5 ) from a half–step below (
4 ˆ
4 ) and from

a half–step above (
2 ˆ
6 ) simultaneously.

Figure 21.1.1
In minor,
2 ˆ
6 doesn’t require a flat because
ˆ
6 is lowered in the minor key
signature.

21.3 Analyzing Augmented Sixth Chords
There are three general types of augmented sixth chords—theItalian aug-

mented sixth chord(“ It

+6
”), theFrench augmented sixth chord(“ Fr
+6
”),
and theGerman augmented sixth chord(“ Ger

+6
”). These geographic la-
bels have persisted throughout the years despite the fact that no reasoning has

been found for these designations.

1
All types of augmented sixth chords contain scale degrees
2 ˆ
6 and
4 ˆ
4. To
these two scale degrees, the It

+6
adds
ˆ
1. The three notes of the It
+6
(
2 ˆ
6 ,
4 ˆ
4 ,
and
ˆ
1 ) form the foundation of the Fr

+6
and Ger
+6
. The Fr

+6
adds
ˆ
2 to the
Italian augmented sixth chord’s
2 ˆ
6 ,
4 ˆ
4 , and
ˆ
1 , and the Ger

+6
adds
2 ˆ
3 to the
Italian’s
2 ˆ
6 ,
4 ˆ
4 , and
ˆ
1 , as is shown in the example below.

1
The 1964 Harvard Dictionary of Music states these chords are “rather point-
lessly... distinguished as ‘Italian,’ ‘German,’ and ‘French’ sixth... ”

Minor
The final chord on the first line—the Enharmonic German
+6
or EnGer
+6
—respells
the
2 ˆ
3 as a
4 ˆ
2 because the EnGer
+6
resolves only to major I
6
4

. The EnGer

+6
does not occur in minor.
21.5 Examples with Augmented Sixth Chords
Since our process for analyzing chords has been to stack them up in thirds to
determine the root and quality, it is worth examing these four augmented sixth
chords as stacks of thirds.

Figure 21.3.1:Augmented Sixth Chords Stacked in Thirds
Notice that all augmented sixth chords contain a
◦
3 when stacked in 3rds.
None of the chords we have studied so far contain diminished thirds.
Principle 21.3.2 Augmented Sixth Chords.When you encounter a chord
with a diminished third, it is an augmented sixth chord.
Once you determine the chord you are analyzing has a
◦
3,analyze the scale
degreesto determine which type of augmented sixth chord it is.
21.4 Lead–Sheet Analysis of Augmented Sixth Chords
When using lead–sheet symbols for augmented sixth chords, we will treat them
as major–minor seventh chords built on
2 ˆ
6 , since that matches the sonic qual-
ity of the augmented sixth chords and is similar to how they occur and are
spelled in jazz and popular music. The chords in parentheses are enharmonic
respellings of the three augmented sixth chord types.

Figure 21.4.1:Augmented Sixth Chords Stacked in Thirds
In the example above, we see a disagreement between “Classical” analysis
and lead–sheet analysis. The fundamental concept of lead-sheet analysis is
to show root, quality, and inversion. The “Classical” spelling and the Classi-
cal analysis of augmented sixth chords show the direction of resolution (with
the chromatically raised notes), which necessitate the need for original labels,
since we don’t have a Roman numeral or a lead–sheet symbol that would com-
municate a chord containing a diminished third above the root (that is then
inverted!).
Therefore, when you are asked to provide lead–sheet symbols for augmented
sixth chords, analyze each one as if it is a dominant 7th chord with a misspelled
7th (A
2
–C–E
2
–F
4
instead of A
2
–C–E
2
–G
2
).

29.4 Voice Leading Augmented Sixth Chords
21.5.1 The Italian Augmented Sixth Chord
The first examples, from the first movement of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony,
shows an Italian augmented sixth chord (It
+6
) in C minor with the “Classical”
spelling.

21.5.4 The Enharmonic German Sixth
In the following example an “Enharmonic German augmented sixth” chord oc-
curs. While a G
2
7
chord would normally have the notes G
2
–B
2
–D
2
–F
2
, the F
2
is respelled as an E
6
, creating the interval of an augmented sixth, while the
fifth of the chord, D
2
, is respelled as a C
4
, creating the interval of a doubly
augmented fourth. In fact, some music theory textbooks refer to the Enhar-
monic German augmented sixth chord as “the chord of the doubly–augmented
fourth.” The spelling is this way because the C
4
will resolve upward to a D
6
,
the third of a major I
6
4
chord.

21.6 Descending Chromatic Bass Lines
A common musical pattern is the descending chromatic bass line (
ˆ
1 –
ˆ
7 –
2 ˆ
7 –
ˆ
6
2 ˆ
6 –

5 ). Composers harmonize descending chromatic bass lines with all manner
of harmonies, including secondary chords, borrowed chords, augmented sixth
chords, and rarely–used diatonic chords. Below are some examples from the
past four centuries.

22.1 Modulation
22.1 Modulation

At its simplest,modulationis a change of key that happens within a compo-

sition. In popular music, the change of key will often be called a “key change”

instead of a “modulation.” Those who study classical music theory typically

reserve the term “modulation” for the slower and more subtle change of key

that occurs in many classical pieces, although there are similarities between

“key change” in popular music and the classical music term “direct modulation”,

which we will study later in this chapter.

Here are examples of key changes in popular music.

22.2 Tonicization versus Modulation
Studying modulation will require us to distinguish between tonicization, which

we studied recently, and modulation. Tonicization, involving secondary chords,

can be as short as two chords (V/V to V, for example) but can sometimes

encompass several measures as in the following example.

Figure 22.2.2:Reduction of Harmonies from “Abschied”
A modulation to a new key requires an eventual cadence to confirm that new
key. This cadence will often (though not always) have the following cadential
formula:

I
6
4
V I
Pre–Dom. Dom. Dom. Ton.
Table 22.2.3:Cadential Formula to Establish a Key
In his bookForm in Tonal Music, Douglass Green defines a V–I authentic
cadence with a pre–dominant prefix as a “full cadence.”
The cadential formula above is found in the following example.

Figure 22.2.4: J.S. Bach, English Suite No. 4 in F Major, BWV 809, Sara-
bande (ca. 1715)
Notice that this cadential formula establishes a key more strongly than
the simple V–I of an authentic cadence. This means there will be ambiguity
between a tonicization and a short modulation ending in an authentic cadence,
especially in music with fast harmonic rhythm, like Bach chorales (usually in
quarter–note harmonic rhythm).

To determine pivot chords and the new key, listen to the music to hear the
cadence in the new key, then work backward from the cadence to see if the
dominant in the new key was approached by pre-dominant chords (ii or IV)
in the new key. Then, analyze from the beginning of the phrase until you reach
the new key. Finally, look for a logical pivot point. Sometimes two successive
chords could logically be pivot chords. If so, include two chords on either side
of your pivot bracket.

Before we start analyzing and writing modulations, we will examine key
22.3. KEY RELATIONSHIPS 273

relationships and pivot chords.

22.3 Key Relationships
In the Baroque and Classical eras, composers typically modulated to the dom-

inant (when starting in a major key) or to the relative major (when starting in

a minor key). In the Romantic era, composers experimented with modulating

to more remote (or perhaps adventurous) key areas, described as “foreign” to

the home key.

“Closely related” keys have key signatures one degree “sharper” or “flat-
ter” than the starting key. For any major or minor key, there are five closely

related keys, including the relative major or minor of the home key.

Figure 22.3.1:Closely Related Keys with A Major as Home Key
Key signatures that are not closely related are said to be “foreign” or
“distantly related.” We will see that some types of modulations from the

Romantic era, like common–tone modulations, exploit foreign key relationships

to dramatic effect.

22.4 Modulations with Diatonic Pivot Chords
Modulations with pivot chords will be analyzed using a pivot bracket, as we’ve

seen earlier in the chapter.

In adiatonic common chord modulation, the pivot chords will be
diatonic in both keys.

Figure 22.4.3: Roman Numerals for Diatonic Common Chords in G major
and D major
If you are a composer wanting to write a diatonic common chord modula-
tion, you need to determine the best place within a progression to pivot to the
new key. To do this, you need to consider the harmonic function of the pivot
chords.
22.4.2 Harmonic Functions of Diatonic Pivot Chords
In terms of harmonic function, composers typically do not use a pivot chord
that has dominant function in the new key because such a modulation might
sound abrupt and unconvincing. Instead, the pivot chord in the first key often
has tonic or tonic prolongation function.
In the following example, the pivot chord simultaneously has tonic function
in the first key and pre–dominant function in the second key. This creates a
more seamless and less jarring progression to the second key.

Look for recurring accidentals, then add them to the key signature to
determine the new key

chord in at least one (and sometimes both) of the keys involved in the modu-

lation.

22.6.2 Borrowed Common Chord
In modulation byborrowed common chord(or mode mixture), the pivot
chord will be a borrowed chord in one of the keys involved in the modulation.
In the following example, a borrowed chord, i

in D
2
minor, rewritten as a
C
4
minor chord, is reinterpreted as vi

Figure 22.6.3: Schubert, Schwanegesang, D. 957, “Frühlingssehnsucht”
(1828)
In the example above, Schubert bridges the tonal distance between D minor
and A
2
minor with N
6
5
(note the dominant–seventh quality of the Neapolitan
in this instance), which acts as a V
6
5
in A
2
minor, a tritone away from D
minor.
22.6.4 Augmented Sixth Common Chord
In the next chapter, we will examine how Augmented Sixth chords are enhar-
monically reinterpreted in a process known as enharmonic modulation.
22.7 Modulations Without Pivot Chords
This section contains the following subsections below:
Direct Modulation
Common–Tone Modulation
Sequential Modulation
22.7.1 Direct Modulation
Direct modulation(also known as phrase modulation) is a type of modula-
tion where a composer decides to move suddenly to a new key without using
pivot chords or preparing the new tonic with its dominant.

Figure 22.7.1:Schubert,Schwanegesang, D. 957, “Liebesbotschaft” (1828)
In the example below from the second song of the same song cycle as the
example above, Schubert does not attempt to change gradually from C minor
to A
2
major, but instead stops on a half cadence in C minor and begins on the
tonic in A
2
major in the next bar.

Direct modulation is the most common type of “modulation” found in pop-
ular music. At the beginning of this chapter we defined this type of modulation
in popular music as “key change.”

Figure 22.7.3: James Horner and Will Jennings, “My Heart Will Go On”
(1997)
With direct modulation, composers do not make any attempt to connect
two different keys through any pivot chords or common tones. In the next sec-
tion, we examine how composers connect two keys through a common tone.
22.7.2 Common–Tone Modulation
Incommon–tone modulation, two chords are connected through a single
note to bridge to distance between two keys.
In the following example, the note C
4
acts as a hinge between a C
4
major
chord (V in F
4
minor) and an A dominant seventh chord (V
7
in D major).

22.7.2.1 Chromatic Mediants
In a common–tone modulation, the two chords connecting the two keys are typ-
ically in a chromatic mediant relationship.Chromatic mediantsare chords
with roots a third apart that share only one common tone and have the same
quality (both are major or both are minor).

22.7.3 Sequential Modulation
Modulation can also be accomplished by sequence. In asequential modula-
tion, a melody and its accompanying harmonies are repeated at a new pitch
level to establish or lead to a new key. In the following example, the sequence
of the original idea occurs in the new key.

23.1 Enharmonic Modulation
23.1 Enharmonic Modulation

In anenharmonic modulation, the pivot chord is almost always misspelled

in one of the keys and therefore must be reconceptualized enharmonically by

the analyst. In this regard, an enharmonic modulation is a harmonic pun.

Here is a pun from Shakespeare’sRichard III, Act 1, Scene 1:
Now is the winter of our discontent

Made glorious summer by this sun of York

The “sun” of York is thesonof York, King Edward IV.

Here is a simple enharmonic modulation:

Figure 23.1.1:Enharmonic Modulation from C major to B minor
Like a verbal pun, this harmonic pun is effective because the third chord
(G

7
) has two “meanings”—in the context of C major, G
7
is V
7
and the root
wants to cadence down a fifth to C, but the G

7
is a Ger
+6
in the context of
B minor, where the root of the G

7
wants to progress down a half step to a
chord of dominant function, i

in the example above.

Figure 23.1.2
Notice that the G
7
can only be spelled correctly in one of the keys—either
as a dominant seventh chord on G (G–B–D–F) or as a Ger
+6
on G (G–B–D–E
4
),
hence the term “enharmonic modulation.” The analyst must envision the other
spelling (the one not shown) to understand the double context, in the same
way “sun of York” must be envisioned as “son of York.”
We will encounter two sonorities used in enharmonic modulations: the
dominant seventh sonority and the diminished seventh sonority.
23.2 The V7 and Ger+6 as Pivot Chords
In this first type of enharmonic modulation, the pivot to the new key will
consist of the V
7
being enharmonically reinterpreted as a Ger
+6
, or the Ger
+6
being enharmonically reinterpreted as V
7
. Secondary dominants, like V

7
/
IV,
V
7
/
V, etc., will also be reinterpreted harmonically as Ger
+6
chords (and vice
versa) in enharmonic modulations.
As we saw in the previous section, the dominant seventh chord and the
Ger
+6
chord have the same sound but are spelled differently. This involves a
fairly straightforward enharmonic respelling. Most commonly, the top note of
the chord is enharmonically respelled to envision the enharmonic alternative.

Figure 23.2.1
Each chord above implies a key based on its spelling: the dominant seventh
chord occurs diatonically only on the
ˆ
5 scale degree in major, while the Ger
+6
chord most commonly occurs with the lowest note on the lowered
ˆ
6 scale degree.
Less commonly, the bottom three notes could be respelled and the upper-
most note could be retained as a common tone.

Remember, you will not see this respelling in the music you are analyzing.
You must be able to visualize the enharmonic respelling in order to analyze
the enharmonic modulation correctly.
The examples below illustrate some of the ways this enharmonic modulation
occurs in pieces from the literature
In the first example from Tchaikovsky’sNutcrackerballet, a D
7
is spelled
on the staff as D–F
4
–A–B
4
so that it sounds like a V
7
/
IV in D major but is
spelled and resolves as a Ger
+6
in the key of F
4
minor.

can be enharmonically reinterpreted.

Figure 23.3.1:The Four Resolutions of a Diminished Seventh Sonority
In the example above, each note of the vii
◦ 7
chord was treated in turn as
the
ˆ
7 scale degree and resolved up by half step. In the example below, each
note of the chord is resolved as if it were the 7th of the chord, moving down
by half step to the root of a dominant seventh chord.

Figure 23.3.2:Resolutions of a Diminished Seventh Sonority to a Dominant
Seventh Sonority
This means that for any diminished seventh chord, you should be able to
imagine the other three respellings in the same way you can imagine other
spellings of words liketwo(i.e.,toandtoo) orthere(theirandthey’re).
In the following examples, a vii
◦ 7
chord is enharmonically reinterpreted in
a new key.
In the first example, Beethoven enharmonically reinterprets F
4
◦ 7
/
C in G
minor (vii
◦ 4
3
) as vii
◦ 4
2
in E minor (D
4
◦ 7
/
C), which resolves to a V
7
chord in
E minor.

Figure 23.3.3:Beethoven, Pathétique Sonata, Op. 13, I (1798)
In the next example from the second movement of Beethoven’s Fifth Sym-
phony, Beethoven modulates from C major to A
2
major by enharmonically

reinterpreting an E

◦ 7
chord in C (vii
◦ 7
/
IV) as vii
◦ 4
2
in A
2
(G
◦ 7
/
F
2
). Notice
the unusual resolution of the vii

◦ 4
2
chord to a Ger
+6
chord by leading all three
of the upper voices of the vii

◦ 4
2
up by half step to the Ger
+6
, which itself is
unusually spelled in the key of A

2
major (E–A
2
–C
2
–D instead of F
2
–A
2
–C
2
–D).

Figure 23.3.4:Beethoven, Symphony No. 5, Op. 67, II (1808)
In the final example of this section, Schubert reinterprets a G
4
◦ 7
in G
minor as an E
4
◦ 7
chord in B minor (vii
◦ 6
5
/
V). The G
4
◦ 7
chord in G minor
is analyzed as vii
◦ 4
2
/
iv, meaning it could resolve to a C minor chord, but it
could also have been interpreted as vii
◦ 4
3
/
VI, or as tonicizing an E
2
major
chord. Because the chord never resolves in G minor, one cannot be certain of
the intended resolution. Remember that diminished triads are not tonicized,
so the G
4
◦ 7
would not be considered as tonicizing the note A (the root of the
ii
◦
chord) or F
4
(the root of the vii
◦
chord).

24.1 Binary and Ternary Form
24.1 Binary and Ternary Form
In this chapter we will compare the following:
Sectional versus Continuous
Binary versus Ternary
Rounded Binary versus Ternary
24.2 Sectional versus Continuous
We apply the descriptor “sectional” to a binary or ternary form when the first
section (the A section) ends on the tonic. (Note: We use lowercase letters to
refer to phrases and uppercase letters to refer to sections.)

Figure 24.2.1:Brahms,Fünf Lieder, Op. 49, No. 4 “Wiegenlied” (1868)
The term “continuous” is used the first section of a binary or ternary form
doesnotend on the tonic chord. While this often means the first section ends
in a new key, it can also mean the first section ends on the dominant chord in
a half cadence.

Figure 24.2.2:Haydn, Symphony No. 94 in G major, Hob.I:94, II (1791)
In naming any binary or ternary form, use the terms sectional or continuous
before binary or ternary, for example “sectionalbinary,” “continuousbinary,”
“sectionalternary,” or “continuousternary.”
Other descriptors include “two–reprise,” which meansboththe first sec-
tion (the A section) and second section (the A’ or B section) are repeated, and
312 CHAPTER 24. BINARY AND TERNARY FORMS

“rounded,” used in conjunction with binary (“rounded binary”) to specify that

the opening material returns after the contrasting section.

In the following sections we will discuss three types of binary forms:
Balanced Binary
Rounded Binary
“Simple” Binary (usually called “binary”)
24.3 Balanced Binary
Abalanced binaryform, according to Douglass Green in his book,Form in

Tonal Music, features a binary form with a first section (the A section) ending

in a new key, and the second section endingwith essentially the same cadence,

now transposed to the original key, as in the following piece by Bach.

Because the first section of a balanced binary ends in a new key, it is
inherently acontinuousbinary form.
Balanced binary form can be found in movements from the Baroque era,
including dance suites by Bach, Handel, and others. The movement below
shows the endings of the first and section sections of the Courante from J.S.
Bach’s French Suite No. 6 in E major, BWV 817.

Figure 24.4.2:Schubert, 20 Minuets, D. 41, No. 18 in F major
This form of the example above would be called “two–reprise continuous
rounded binary form” because:
Two–reprise means both the first and second sections repeat
Continuous means the first section does not end on the tonic chord
24.5. SIMPLE BINARY 317

In a rounded binary form the opening melody returns after contrasting
material
Rounded binary form is often encountered in compositions during the Classical

era (1750–1825) in music by Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, especially as the

form of a theme from a theme and variations, and as the minuet and/or trio

section in a Minuet and Trio.

24.5 Simple Binary
“Simple” binaryis a term used to describe a binary form that does not have

features like the similar endings of a balanced binary or the return of opening

material like the rounded binary. You will encounter this type of binary form

in music especially throughout the Baroque era, as well as in the early Classical

era.

24.6. BINARY PRINCIPLE 319
Notice in the example above that the first section and second section can
begin similarly in a binary form, resulting in the large–scale form AA’. The
second section often features development of the primary idea from the first
section. We will discuss development in the next chapter.
24.6 Binary Principle
Binary principle, as defined by Peter Spencer and Peter Temko in their
bookA Practical Approach to the Study of Form in Music, states that the
first section of a binary form modulates to a new key and the second section
modulates back to the first key. We find this principal exemplified in a high
percentage of binary forms in the Baroque era, and diagrammed in the example
below.

Figure 24.7.2:Diagram illustrating Binary Principle
Character pieces from the Romantic era with titles such as “Nocturne,”
“Intermezzo,” and “Song Without Words,” among others, by composers such
as Schubert, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Schumann, and Brahms, are often in a
larger ternary form where each section might be longer than eight bars.
Below are examples from a larger ternary piece, Rachmaninov’s Prelude in
C–sharp minor, Op.3 No.2.

24.7.1 Compound Ternary
Acompound ternaryis a ternary form in which one of the sections (the A
or the B) is itself a binary or ternary form. Examples can be found in the
minuet and trio as well as the da capo aria.
In the next section, we will examine the differences between rounded binary
and ternary.
24.8 Distinguishing between Rounded Binary and Ternary
In homework and on the test, you will encounter pieces that are five or six
phrases long that could be rounded binary or ternary. While other authors
have their own means to differentiate rounded binary from ternary, this text
offers the following criteria to consider:
1.Proportion: consider the proportion of the contrasting section to the
other sections. If the contrasting section is too small to stand alone, the
form is more likely to be rounded binary.
24.8. DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN ROUNDED BINARY AND TERNARY 323

2.Nature: consider the nature of the contrasting section.
(a) If the melody is built from motives from the first section, the form is
likely to be a rounded binary. Ternary form will have a contrasting
melody in the contrasting section.
(b) If the harmony consists mostly of a dominant pedal, or a V chord
alternating with a I or I
6
4
chord, the form is likely to be a rounded
binary.
3.Era: consider the era when the piece was written. A piece by a Baroque
composer (J.S. Bach, Handel, Scarlatti, Couperin) or Classical composer
(Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven) is more likely to be in rounded binary
form, whereas a piece by a Romantic era composer (Schubert, Schumann,
Chopin, Mendelssohn, and Brahms, among others) is more likely to be
in ternary form. Note that these are generalities. Baroque and Clas-
sical composers will write compositions in ternary form and Romantic
composers will write pieces in rounded binary form.
Consider the following piece by Beethoven:

Figure 24.8.1:Beethoven, Eleven Bagatelles, Op. 119, No. 9
24.9. PRACTICE EXERCISES 325

In terms of proportion, bars 9–12 contain contrasting material to bars 1–8.
Because the contrasting material lasts for half as long as the open section, we

consider the proportion as pointing toward rounded binary.

In terms of the nature of the contrasting section, the melody is built from
the contour of the first four notes of the first measure, and the harmony al-

ternates between V and I

6
4
. Both the harmony and melody point us in the

direction of rounded binary.

Finally, consider the era in which Beethoven lived. Is he considered a Classi-
cal or Romantic composer? This is a difficult question to answer, as Beethoven

is a unique figure who is a bridge between the Classical and Romantic eras.

However, it’s generally safe to consider Beethoven as belonging to the Classical

era, and therefore as likely to write a rounded binary form.

You will encounter examples on homework and the test where these three
criteria are not unanimous and you will have to weigh the evidence to come to

a conclusion.

24.8.1 Written–Out Repeats

Occasionally you will encounter an example where the repeats are written out.

When you encounter such a piece, put the repeats in your diagram even though

there are not in the score.

Sonata and Rondo Forms

25.1 Sonata Form
Sonata form, also known as “first–movement form,” is “[t]he most important

principle of musical form, or formal type, from the Classical period well into

the 20th century,” according to the Grove Music Online. The purpose of this

chapter is to serve as an introduction to formal, thematic, and harmonic aspects

of sonata form. We will focus on sonata form as it existed during the height

of the Classical era. Further and more detailed study of sonata form occurs in

higher–level music theory courses.

25.1.1 Diagram of Sonata Form

Below is a generalized diagram of sonata form, which serves as our starting

point. Real–world examples will contain differences and elaborations.

In major:

In minor:

PT = Primary Theme
ST = SecondaryTheme
CT = ClosingTheme
It is fairly common for a piece in sonata form to have multiple secondary
themes (ST

1
, ST
2
). In some sonatas, the development section features new
material. Some sonatas will not have a closing theme. As we work with real

world examples, you will see the ways in which composers realize sonata form.

While the diagram above designates three large sections (exposition, devel-
opment, recapitulation), repeat signs in sonatas from the classical era designate

the sonata as a two-reprise form—the exposition repeats, then the development

and recapitulation repeat as a single unit. Douglass Green, in his bookForm

in Tonal Music, notes the sonata’s evolution from and synthesis of rounded

binary and balanced binary:

335
336 CHAPTER 25. SONATA AND RONDO FORMS

The typical sonata form, as it appeared in the 18th century, is
a combination of rounded and balanced binary. It begins the
return with a restatement of the opening of part one, as in the
rounded binary, and it closes with a restatement of the final
sections (second and closing themes) of part one transposed to
the tonic, as in the balanced binary.
25.1.2 Sonatina Form

While “sonatina” is sometimes understood to mean a short sonata or an easy

sonata for beginners, in terms of form,sonatina formis sonata form with-

out the development section. Sonatina form is sometimes encountered in the

second, slow movement of a larger work like a symphony, as well as in over-

tures. A familiar piece in sonatina form is the “Miniature Overture” fromThe

Nutcrackerby Tchaikovsky.

25.1.3 Sonata Principle

Important to sonata form is sonata principle, which Charles Rosen discusses

in his bookSonata Forms.

The exposition of a sonata form presents the thematic material and
articulates the movement from tonic to dominant in various ways so
that it takes on the character of a polarization or opposition. The
essential character of this opposition may be defined as a large–scale
dissonance: the material played outside the tonic (i.e., in the second
group) is dissonant with respect to the center of stability, or tonic.
Sonata style did not invent this concept ofdissonant section, but
it was the first style to make it the generating force of an entire
movement.
1
Rosen continues:

The dominant is conceived as adissonant tonalityin the exposi-
tion....The polarization, in fact, leads to the concept of adissonant
section, which raises the dissonant interval or chord to a higher
power: that is, a simple reintroduction of the tonic key will no
longer serve as a resolution, but the section outside the tonic needs
to be resolved as a whole.

25.2. THE FOUR STRUCTURAL FUNCTIONS IN MUSIC 337

25.1.4 The Monothematic Sonata

Haydn was especially fond of restating the Primary Theme in the dominant

where the Secondary Theme would normally occur. This reinforces the idea

that the tonal design of a sonata was as important as thematic design.

25.2 The Four Structural Functions in Music
In the “Structural Functions” chapter ofA Practical Approach to the Study

of Form in Music, Peter Temko and Peter Spencer enumerate four structural

functions.

Expository function
Transitional function
Developmental function
Terminative function
25.2.1 Expository Function

Music expressingexpository functionmaintains a stable tonal center and

clear melodies, usually with well–defined phrases. The vast majority of the

music we encountered in binary and ternary form in the last chapter was ex-

pository in nature. Additionally, the primary and secondary themes in a sonata

form are usually have expository function. Below is the secondary theme from

the first movement of Mozart’s Piano Sonata, K. 333.

Figure 25.2.1:Mozart, Piano Sonata, K. 333, I, Secondary Theme

allel double period within the larger sonata form. Cadences are important
demarcations within a form.

often features a contrasting accompanimental texture more rhythmically active
than preceding expository material. Tonicizations may also occur within a
transition. Transitions are sometimes called bridges. Mozart and Haydn often
ended their sonata form transitions with a half cadence followed by a rest to
25.2. THE FOUR STRUCTURAL FUNCTIONS IN MUSIC 339

signal that the secondary theme was about to commence. Again, notice the

importance of cadences to demarcate the form.

342 CHAPTER 25. SONATA AND RONDO FORMS

25.2.3 Developmental Function

Music withdevelopmental functionoften contains sequences and fragmen-

tation of earlier melodies. In addition, developmental music modulates through

multiple keys. Phrase lengths may be irregular and elisions may be used by

the composer to keep the listener off balance.

It can sometimes be difficult to distinguish between transitional and devel-
opmental music. A development section is typically longer than a transition

and therefore will contain more sections of a varying nature and as well as a

greater number of modulations.

Examples from a development section can be found in Section 11.1 of this
text. Note the fragmentation and sequencing of melodic ideas as well as the

different keys expressed in the examples throughout that section.

25.2.4 Terminative Function

Terminative functionis typically expressed through a rather emphatic al-

ternation of tonic and dominant harmonies, usually to affirm a tonal center.

The closing theme of a sonata has terminative function.

Go to the Practice Exercises at the end of this chapter to practice identifying
these four structural functions aurally.
25.3 Rondo Form
Arondois a piece that begins with a refrain (an A section) that alternates with
episodes (B and C). The 5-part rondo, an example of which we encountered
in an earlier chapter, has ABACA form or ABABA form. The 7–part rondo
typically has ABACABA form, although other designs exist. A diagram for
7–part Classical form is shown below.

The refrain (the A section) is always in tonic. The first episode (the B
section) was typically in a closely related key—the dominant (V) if in major
or the mediant (III) if in minor. There was greater variety of keys used for
344 CHAPTER 25. SONATA AND RONDO FORMS
the second episode (the C section), including tonic minor in a major sonata or
the submediant (vi or VI). A retransition in this case is defined as a transition
returning to material previously heard.
Note that the B section being first stated in the dominant then later in tonic
is an example of sonata principle, a principle which occurred in many Classical
era pieces (see Charles Rosen’sSonata Formsfor more on sonata principle).
An example of Classical seven–part rondo form is found below in the third
and final movement of Beethoven’s Pathétique Sonata, Op. 13.

The first episode (the B section) is in the mediant, Eb major, the relative
major of C minor. The primary purpose of this first episode to establish a key
different than the starting key. Notice that the themes during this episode are
not particularly tuneful.

To review a simple, five-part rondo form, see the section on the second
movement ofEine kleine nachtmusikin the chapter on Creating Contrast Be-

tween Sections.

25.3.1 Sonata Rondo Form

Sonata rondo form is a rondo in which the second episode (the C section) is

replaced by a development section, resulting in a design of A-B-A-Dev.-A-B-

A.

25.4 Rondo Character
Rondo character is characterized by quick tempo in duple meter with light

character, typically achieved through the use of staccato articulation. This

348 CHAPTER 25. SONATA AND RONDO FORMS

duple meter could be either simple (

2
4
) or compound (
6
8
). During the Classi-
cal era, the final movement of a multi-movement composition, e.g. a sonata,

quartet, or symphony, was often in rondo character. Not all pieces in rondo

form are in rondo character.

Listen to the following six examples to develop familiarity with rondo char-

26.1 Voice Leading
26.1 Voice Leading

Voice leading, also known as part writing, refers to rules about melodic

motions of voices involved in harmonic progressions. The primary concerns

behind voice leading rules are independence of parts, voicing of chords, and

economy of melodic motion for the sake of singable parts.

“SATB” voice leading refers to four–part chords scored for soprano (S), alto
(A), tenor (T), and bass (B) voices. Three–part chords are often specified as

SAB (soprano, alto, bass) but could be scored for any combination of three

voice types. SATB voice leading will also be referred to as “chorale–style” voice

leading.

26.2 Types of Motion
Definitions must be set out regarding types of motion between two parts.
Contrary motionoccurs when the two voices move in opposite direction
to each other by step or leap.
Oblique motionoccurs when one voice stays the same and the other voice
moves up or down by step or leap.
Similar motionoccurs when both voices move in the same (or “similar”)
direction—both up (by step or leap) or both down (by step or leap);
similar motion is also called “direct” motion
Parallel motionis a specific type of similar motion and occurs when both
voices move in the same direction by the same interval—both up by step,
or both down by a third. Parallel motion is also known asdirect motion.

26.3 Objectionable Parallels
When writing in three or four parts, avoid having any two voices move in par-
allel fifths or parallel octaves (and their octave equivalents—parallel twelfths
and parallel unisons). In the Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, and Romantic
eras, these objectional parallels were thought to destroy the independence of
the voices. Parallel 3rds, 4ths, and 6ths were considered acceptable. Parallel
2nds and 7ths generally were not used.

For the purpose of music theory class, we will set out restrictions for voice
ranges that are likely more limited than those found among vocalists in the

class. These voice ranges are based on those most commonly found in J.S.
Bach’s371 Chorales.

26.5 Rules of Melody
Rules of melody have been included in books on composing, writing counter-
point, and music theory for centuries. The purpose of the rules of melody as
described in this text are to aid in the construction of singable melodies and to
reflect a summary of melodic practice in music. (Remember that each part in
an SATB composition is considered a melody.) Because these rules of melody
are based stylistically on the melodies found in J.S. Bach’s371 Chorales, you
will no doubt be familiar with exceptions that have occurred in music composed
since Bach’s death in 1750.
1.Tendency tonesshould resolve:
ˆ
7 goes to
ˆ
8 and, to a lesser extent,
ˆ
4
goes to
ˆ
3 (other tendency tones are
ˆ
6 and
ˆ
2 , both of which should resolve
down by step)
Avoid augmented intervals
Leaps larger than a 4th and leaps of diminished intervals should change
direction after the leap
Consecutive leaps should outline a triad
The following example demonstrates how difficult a melody can be to sing
when these rules are broken

26.6 Rules of Spacing
Generally, the upper three voice parts (soprano, alto, and tenor) are kept close
together. The general rule of spacing is to keep the distance between soprano
and alto as well as the distance between alto to tenor within an octave of each
other. Allowing a distance greater than an octave between soprano and alto
(or between alto and tenor) is consideredspacing error. The distance from
the bass to the tenor can be greater than an octave.

26.7 Voice–leading Root Position Triads in Four Parts
We are writing in four parts but triads have three notes. We will double the
root of every root position chord. (The root is in the bass when a triad is in
root position, so we are doubling the bass note in an upper part.)
Principle 26.7.1 Doubling rule for root position triads.Always double
the root in root position triads.
To move from one chord to the next, consider the interval that occurs
melodically in the bass line between the current chord and subsequent one.

In the upper three parts (soprano, alto, and tenor): retain the two common
tones and move the other voice by step

Figure 26.7.3
Exception: When the bass moves by the interval of a 2nd in the deceptive
cadence in the minor mode (V–VI in C minor),alwaysmove the 3rd of the

V chord up by step while the other notes (the 5th and the doubled root)

move in contrary motion to the bass. In this situation, two voices move in an

upward direction and two voices move in a downward direction. This results

in a doubled 3rd in the VI chord. In the major mode, use this voice–leading

solution if

ˆ
7 is in the soprano voice (because it is a tendency tone).

26.8. VOICE LEADING FIRST–INVERSION TRIADS 363

26.8 Voice Leading First–Inversion Triads
Instead of focusing on the intervallic distance the bass part travels between

roots of chords, voice leading first inversion triads requires focusing on the

doubling or voicing of the chord itself. When approaching or leaving a first in-

version chord, move as smoothly as possible while avoid objectionable parallels,

spacing errors, and melodic errors.

26.8.1 Voicing a First Inversion Chord

In contrast to the doubling rule for root position chords (i.e., “double the bass”),

donotdouble the bass note for first inversion triads. Instead, double the root

or fifth, depending on which can be approached and left most smoothly.

26.12Summary of Doubling Rules for Triads
To generalize, here are the doubling rules for voice leading triads in root posi-
tion, first inversion, and second inversion:
Root Position Chords: DOUBLE THE BASS
First–Inversion Chords: DO NOT DOUBLE THE BASS
◦Exception: vii
◦ 6
and ii
◦ 6
: DOUBLE THE BASS
◦Exception: Consecutive first inversion chords—alternate between
DOUBLE THE BASS and DO NOT DOUBLE THE BASS
Second–Inversion Chords: DOUBLE THE BASS
27.6 Practice Exercises
Day One
For bass movement of a 3rd or 6th, in the upper voices hold one com-
mon tone and move the other two voices by step. For bass movement
of a 2nd, move the upper voices in contrary motion to the bass with
the exception of the deceptive cadence, which has special rules. Keep
track of doubling by specifying which voice has the root, third, or fifth
for each chord.

368 CHAPTER 26. VOICE LEADING TRIADS
For bass movement of a 4th, either (1) hold one common tone and
move the two voices by step, or (2) move the upper voices in the same
direction. Keep track of doubling by specifying which voice has the
root, third, or fifth for each chord.

27.1 Voice Leading Seventh Chords
27.2 Voice Leading Successive Seventh Chords
There is one general rule for voice leading any seventh chord: resolve the 7th of

the chord down by step. All other voices should move smoothly to the nearest

chord tone in a voicing containing the appropriate doubling.

Principle 27.1.1 7th chords.Resolve the 7th of a 7th chord down by step.

progression with acceptable parallel fifths
Notice that parallel fifths occur in this progression because of the upward
resolution of the 7th. These parallel fifths may have been deemed less objec-

tionable because they consist ofunequal fifths(where one of the fifths is in

a case of parallel fifths is diminished).

29.1 Voice Leading Secondary Chords
Sometimes you will encounter a situation where there are successive seventh

chords. This is especially the case in circle of fifth progressions. When voice

leading a circle of fifths progression with root position seventh chords in four

parts (SATB), alternate between incomplete seventh chords (without the fifth

of the chord) and complete seventh chords, as can be seen in the example below

from Vivaldi’s Concerto for Two Violins and Cello in D minor, RV 565.

Principle 27.2.2 Voice Leading Successive Root Position 7th chords.
Alternate between complete and incomplete voicings.
If, on the other hand, you are asked to voice lead a circle of fifths progression
involving inverted seventh chords, always resolve the seventh of each chord
down by step and move the other voices smoothly. You will see the following
pattern: two voices will remain on common tones (shown with ties) while the
other two voices resolve downward by step.

29.3 Voice Leading the Neapolitan Chord
7
to I Progression
In voice leading the V
7
to I progression in four parts, one must deliberately
choose one of the following methods:
“Strict” resolution:
(a) Complete V
7
to incomplete I: resolve
ˆ
7 up and
ˆ
4 and
ˆ
2 down. This
means resolving the 3rd of the V
7
chord (7) up and the 7th and 5th
of the V
7
chord down. For the sake of consistency in terminology,
the examples below label
ˆ
7 ,
ˆ
2 , and the 7th of the chord. The
incomplete I chord will have a tripled root and one 3rd.

In piano music you will sometimes find “improper” resolution of the 7th of a
chord because it fits the hand better. This should be considered an exception
and will not be acceptable in voice leading exercises completed for this class.

27.4 The Special Resolution of vii
◦ 7
(and vii
ø 7
)
The vii
◦ 7
and vii
ø 7
chords consist entirely of tendency tones (
ˆ
7 ,
ˆ
2 ,
ˆ
4 ,
ˆ
6 ).
If one resolves all of those tendency tones correctly (
ˆ
2 –
ˆ
1 ,
ˆ
4 –
ˆ
3 ,
ˆ
6 –
ˆ
5 ,
ˆ
7 –
ˆ
8 ),
one might write parallel 5ths depending on the voicing of the vii
◦ 7
and vii
ø 7
chord. Therefore, be sure to memorize the following principle:
Principle 27.4.1 Resolving vii
◦ 7
.When the 7th of a vii
◦ 7
or vii
ø 7
chord
is voiced above the 3rd of the chord, resolve the 3rd of the chord (scale degree
ˆ

Figure 27.4.2:Resolving vii

The third measure above shows that revoicing the chord is another solution,
since parallel 4ths are not objectionable in this situation.

If the 7th of the chord is voicedbelow the 3rd of the chord, resolve all
tendency tones normally.

27.5 When to Use Seventh Chords
In your harmonizations of melodies, it is best to use seventh chords to add

tension as you approach tonic function. Therefore, sevenths are added most fre-

quently to chords of dominant function (V and vii

◦
) and chords of pre–dominant
function (ii and, to a lesser extent, IV). (See the harmonic flowchart.) For

this reason, seventh chords like iii

7
, vi
7
, IVM
7
, and IM
7
are less commonly
used and encountered.

28.2 Avoiding Objectionable Parallels
When adding non–chord tones, one must avoid creating objectionable parallels.
To avoid creating parallel 5ths and 8ves when adding non–chord tones, first
identify intervals of 5ths and 8ves between voices in your original voice leading.

386 CHAPTER 28. VOICE LEADING WITH NON–CHORD TONES
Notice that, when non–chord tones are added to different voices on the same
beat, consonant intervals (3rds, 5ths, 6ths, or 8ves) are made. If consonant
intervals can’t be made, the voices are staggered rhythmically (as occurs on
beats 3 and 4 in measure one of the example above).
29.5 Practice Exercises
Analyze the chords with Roman numerals in the blanks below the staff,
then add the specified non–chord tones, specifying suspensions with the
appropriate interval numbers.

Alternate complete voicings with incomplete voicings when voice lead-
ing successive root position seventh chords. Note that with secondary
chords, the 3rd of the chord, typically a raised note, will resolve down by
half step to the 7th of the chord, which is a diatonic note that cancels
out the chromaticism of the previous note.

29.2 Voice Leading Borrowed Chords
Borrowed chords, or chords making use of mode mixture, are handled similarly
to their diatonic versions in terms of voice leading, e.g., ii
ø 7
is handled similarly
to ii
7
. In any of the borrowed chords with
2 ˆ
6 , resolve this tendency tone down

by step whenever possible.

Figure 29.2.2:Resolving

6 down when voice leading borrowed chords
Another situation where you may encounter a borrowed chord is the V–
2
VI
cadence, which should be handled exactly as the deceptive cadence in minor is
handled—resolve the 3rd of the V chord up by step and move the other two
voices in contrary motion to the bass.
There are no specific rules for other borrowed chords such as
2
III,
2
VII, i,
and v; simply voice lead them as smoothly as possible while avoiding objec-
tionable parallels.
20.1 The Neapolitan Chord
There are two rules for voice leading the N
6
chord in four parts:
Double the bass (the third)
Resolve
2 ˆ
2 downto the nearest note in the next chord.

29.4 Voice Leading Augmented Sixth Chords
It may be helpful to review the three types of augmented sixth chords before
discussing how one voice leads them.
The salient accidental in all three augmented sixth chords is
4 ˆ
4 , which
almost always resolves upward to
ˆ
5.

Introduction to Counterpoint

30.1 Species Counterpoint
The seminal composition text,Gradus ad Parnassum(1725), by Johann Joseph
Fux, teaches contrapuntal composition through “species counterpoint.”Species
counterpointuses simple rhythmic values and teaches composers how to write
one, two, three, or four notes against a larger value, usually a whole note. In
this text, we will focus on writing for two voices. In a semester-long college
course in counterpoint, one typically learns to write for up to four voices.
Counterpointcan be thought of as the simultaneous sounding of two or
more melodic lines. An example is shown below.

Textures made of counterpoint are called “contrapuntal” and can be con-
trasted with melody–accompaniment textures, which are called “homophonic.”

30.2 First Species Counterpoint
In first species, we will write note–against–note counterpoint in whole notes.
You will be given a melody, called thecantus firmus (abbreviated “c.f.”),
against which you will write a counterpoint.

Fux enumerates several rules to follow to write in proper sixteenth–century
style (the style of Palestrina). Since this is a brief introduction to writing in
species counterpoint, the rules below are slightly modified and simplified. You
would likely follow stricter rules in a semester–long course in counterpoint.
Begin with an octave or unison.

(b) “Perfect” consonances (unisons, 5ths, 8ves, 12ths) may only be ap-

Only the following leaps are allowed: 3rds, 4ths, 5ths, ascending minor

Following these rules may seem dry and uninspired, but these rules come from

observations of note–by–note details in Renaissance masterpieces by composers

like Palestrina and can make any composer better and more aware of what they

are writing.

species except that one simple dissonance is allowed in second species: the

passing tone. Please see the details below.

Begin your counterpoint with a half note at the octave or unison on either
the first or third beat of the measure; if starting on the third beat, put
a half rest at the beginning of the measure.

Of the two half notes you write in each measure, the first must always be a
consonance (unison, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 8ve, or compound interval equivalent).
If the second is a dissonance, it can only be a passing tone (approached
and left by step). Otherwise, the second note must be a consonance. The
only allowable leaps are the same as in first species.
When crossing barlines, apply the following:
(a) “Imperfect” consonances (3rds and 6ths) can be approached in any
manner.
(b) “Perfect” consonances (unisons, 5ths, 8ves, 12ths) may only be ap-
proached in contrary motion in order to avoid direct 5ths and direct
8ves.
(c) Do not repeat notes across barlines

30.4 Third Species Counterpoint
In third species, one writes four quarter notes to each whole note in the cantus
firmus. Use the following rules.
Begin on an octave or unison. Write four quarter notes to each whole
note in the cantus firmus except for the final measure.
End on a whole note on an octave or unison with the penultimate measure
using one of the following formulas:
(a) If the cantus firmus is in the lower voice, the penultimate measure
of the upper voice can be:
i.
ˆ
4 –
ˆ
5 –
ˆ
6 –
ˆ
7 , or

Concluding formulas:

398 CHAPTER 30. INTRODUCTION TO COUNTERPOINT
When crossing barlines, apply the following:
(a) “Imperfect” consonances (3rds and 6ths) can be approached in any
manner.
(b) “Perfect” consonances (unisons, 5ths, 8ves, 12ths) may only be ap-
proached in contrary motion in order to avoid direct 5ths and direct
8ves.
(c) Do not repeat notes across barlines
Allowable dissonances:
(a) Passing tones are allowable dissonances (but never on the first beat
of the measure).
(b) Thecambiata(see the melodic contour in third measure of the exam-
ple below) is allowed but only with the second note of the measure
as the only dissonant interval.
Direct 5ths and direct 8ves are not allowed and occur when an 8ve or
5th on a downbeat is approached through similar motion.

30.5 Fourth Species Counterpoint
Fourth species deals with writing suspensions (and syncopations). Because this
is only a brief introduction to species counterpoint, you will only encounter the
cantus firmus in the lower voice in fourth species in this text. See the fourth
species rules below.
Start with a half rest, then write a half note an 8ve above thecantus
firmus. The half note on the 3rd beat of every measure but the penul-
timate one ties across the barline to a half note on the first beat of the
succeeding measure.
End on a whole note at the interval of an 8ve above thecantus firmus.
The penultimate measure should contain a 7–6 suspension.
The half note on the third beat of each measure isalwaysa consonance.
If the half note after a tie is a dissonance (4th or 7th), it is a suspension
andmust resolve down by step.
(a) Allowable suspensions in the upper part are 4–3 and 7–6; 9–8 and
2–1 are not allowed.
If the half note after the tie is a consonance (1, 3, 5, 6, 8), it is a synco-
pation and can be left in any manner (by step or leap in any direction).

30.7 Invention Expositions
J.S. Bach’s Two–Part Inventions were not only intended as instructional key-

board pieces but also as examples of how to compose. In this section we will

wed our species counterpoint knowledge with our knowledge of harmony in

order to write a four-measure invention exposition using Bach’s C major and

E minor inventions as models. Note the I–I–V–V–I harmonic progression.

30.7.1 How to Write an Invention Exposition

In the majority of examples, you will be given an invention theme in the first

measure, which you will write an octave lower in the bass part in the second

measure, then a perfect fifth higher than the first measure in the third measure,

the fourth measure will be the third measure transposed down one octave, and,

finally, you will end on the interval of a 10th—tonic in the bass part and
ˆ
3 in

the upper part. Please see the example below.

30.7.2 Altering Themes to Fit the Harmonies
You may find that a theme that leads naturally from I to V needs its
contour alteredwhen progressing from V to I in measures 4 to 5in order
to emphasize the V chord and the dominant–to–tonic harmonic motion.
Modify the contour to emphasize the V chord at the end of the measure,
altering as few notes as possible.

Additionally, you may be given themes that land on
ˆ
3 on the downbeat
of the second measure, not the
ˆ
5 that occurred in the Bach C major and
E minor invention expositions. You will need to alter the theme at the
end of measure 2 to emphasize the I chord as well as make the first bass
note of the third measure the
ˆ
5 scale degree.

Finally, when a theme in minor containing the
ˆ
2 and
ˆ
3 scale degrees in the
first two measures is transposed up a fifth in the succeeding two measures,
scale degrees
ˆ
2 and
2 ˆ
3 will be transposed to↑
ˆ
6 and↑
ˆ
7. The reasoning
is that↑
ˆ
7 is the 3rd of the V chord, and↑
ˆ
6 is a step below, typically a
passing tone. Another way to think of this is touse the melodic minor
scale in the 3rd and 4th measures.

30.7.3 Adding Counterpoint to the Theme Statements
After copying and transposing the theme throughout this four–measure inven-
tion exposition, you will need to add counterpoint to accompany the statements
of the theme in the second, third, and fourth measures. Unlike species coun-
terpoint, your counterpoint in these invention expositionsmust emphasize the
harmonyin each measure.

You may find the need to create “microharmonies” within a measure with
some themes, such as a I–IV–I or I–vii

◦ 6
–I progression even though the over-
riding harmony of the bar is the I chord. Examples are found in the first two

measures of the C major invention.

Given these pieces of information, you are prepared to begin writing tonal
counterpoint in two parts.

30.8 Fugue Analysis
We will now turn to analysis of fugue. Let us set out definitions first.

A fugueis a contrapuntal composition whose form features sections
called expositions and episodes
A fugueexpositionis a section that contains at least one full statement
of the subject of the fugue.
The fuguesubjectis the primary melodic idea and is stated by each
voice in turn in the first exposition.
Theresponse, called “answer” in some texts, is the subject intervallically
altered to start in the original key before modulating to the dominant.
Notice that the third note of the subject in the example below descends
a perfect fourth to the fourth note. In the response in measure 3, the
third note descends a perfect fifth to the fourth note.
Anepisodeis a section that does not contain a full statement of the
fugue subject, but instead develops the subject or other prominent ideas
through fragmentation and sequencing.
404 CHAPTER 30. INTRODUCTION TO COUNTERPOINT

Here is the first exposition of Fugue 2 in C minor in Book I of the J.S. Bach’s

Well–Tempered Clavier. In the first exposition of a fugue, all of the voices state

the subject at least once. It is important to note that a response is considered

equivalent to a subject because the intervallic alterations are so minute.

Figure 30.8.1: First Exposition of Fugue 2 in C minor fromWellTempered

Clavier, Book I (BWV 847)

Thebridge, if it occurs, is a brief modulatory passage that only hap-
penswithinthe first exposition, usually to connect the response to the
subsequent subject statement.
Acountersubjectis counterpoint that consistently accompanies each
occurrence of the subject. “Countersubject 1” is in the alto voice in
measure 3 and in the soprano voice in measure 7. The alternative to using
a countersubject would be for a composer to write different accompanying
counterpoint (labeled as “CTRPT” in the examples) each time a subject
is stated.
Within the bridge (bar 5 in the example above), we see motivic fragmentation

of the subject (“subject head”). Subjects, responses, and countersubjects can

be fragmented into head motives and tail motives in episodes in fugues. In

this fugue, we will see the subject, countersubject 1, and countersubject 2

30.8. FUGUE ANALYSIS 405
fragmented.
Below is the first episode, which contains motivic fragmentation of the
subject and countersubject 1.

Species Counterpoint: Day One

408 CHAPTER 30. INTRODUCTION TO COUNTERPOINT

For each exercise below, write first species (note–against–note) coun-
terpoint. Write the intervallic distance from the cantus firmus (“c.f.”)
to the counterpoint in the blanks above the staff. Remember to begin
and end with an octave or unison, to proceed to the last unison by
step in both voices, and use only consonances (1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10).

30.9. PRACTICE EXERCISES 409

For the exercises below, write second species counterpoint—two half
notes in each measure except the last. Each downbeat must be a con-
sonance. The only dissonance allowed is the passing tone. Write the
intervallic distance from thecantus firmus(“c.f.”) to the counterpoint
in the blanks above the staff. Circle all dissonant numbers (2, 4, and
7) and label passing tones with “pt.”

Introduction to Jazz Theory

This introduction to jazz theory focuses on the types of chords encountered
in jazz, how these chords might be voiced, how to voice lead these chords in
five–part harmony, and scales associated with these chords.
31.1 Jazz Chord Basics
1.Ninth chordsare common in jazz.
(a) Four of the five common seventh chord types in classical and pop-
ular music will have ninths added to them; the exception is the
fully–diminished seventh chord.
i. The
ø 7
chord is also labeled as m
7
(
2
5 )in jazz—C
ø 7
is the same
as Cm
7
(
2
5 ).
(b) In lead–sheet notation,adding “9” to a chord symbol means the 7th
is also present.
(c) “9” is “2” an octave higher and always comes from the major scale
unless otherwise specified.

Alterations (maj,∆,
4
,
2
,+, m, –) are applied as follows:
(a) “maj” or “∆” with 7, 9, 11, or 13 refers to the 7th of the chord being
major, not the 9th, 11th, or 13th.
(b) Lowercase “m” or the minus sign (“–”) means minor and applies to
the 3rd of the chord.
i. The minus sign (–) is equivalent to a flat when placed in front
of 9, 11, or 13 (i.e.,
2
9 and –9 mean the same thing). “ C
4
6
”
(equivalent to “ C
4
m
6
”) means a C
4
minor chord (“ C
4
–”) with
the 6th from major (A
4
). “ C
4
(add –6),” whidh is equivalent to
“ C
4
(add
2
6 ),” means a C
4
major triad with the
2
6 added
(c) The plus sign (+) can mean “augmented triad” or is equivalent to
a sharp when placed in front of 9, 11, or 13. C+7 means a C
augmented triad (“C+”) with a dominant seventh (“7”), not a C
major triad with a major 7th.
417
418 CHAPTER 31. INTRODUCTION TO JAZZ THEORY
(d) Chromatically altered chord numbers (affecting 6, 9, 11, 13) are
usually set apart by parentheses so as to clearly designate whether
the minus, plus, or sharp, or flat is affecting the chord or the added
note. For example, consider C
2
9 versus C(
2
9) versus C7(
2
9).

If a chord has a 9th but no 7th, use the term “add 9.” In popular
music, sometimes “2” or “add 2” is used instead (refer to the Chord Labels
section).
m∆7 Chord: In addition to the five common seventh chord types, jazz
includes use of the minor–major seventh chord (a minor triad with a
major seventh). This chord will commonly have a ninth added as well.
You will see the “major” symbol (∆) used primarily in jazz. Popular
music typically uses “maj” instead.

5.11thand13thChords: 11ths and 13ths always come from the major
scale unless otherwise specified. (“11” is “4” an octave higher and “13” is
“6” an octave higher.)
(a) All numbers up to the highest number are assumed. C9 means that
the 7th is also included below the 9th. C13 means C–E–G–B
2
–D–F–A—everything
up to the 13th. For this reason, we will use C9(13)—to specify
C–E–G–B
2
–D–A—instead of C13, which would be used in the real
world to describe these notes. In the real world, a composer or
arranger writing C13 will assume the pianist or guitarist knows to
omit the unaltered 11th because it clashes with the major 3rd of the
chord. In this music theory course we will be specific as to which
notes are included and left out.

9
chords: If a chord has a 6th and a 9th, call it a
6
9
chord (C
6
9
) instead
of a
9
6
chord. The major
6
9
uses the major third (C–E–G–A–D) while the
minor
6
9
uses the minor third (C–E
2
–G–A–D). The “6” always comes from
the major scale unless otherwise specified. (Refer to the Chord Labels
section for examples.)
Enharmonic respelling: Jazz musicians will sometimes respell double–flatted
notes and double–sharped notes enharmonically because for some musi-
cians theory was viewed more from the aspect of the piano than the staff.
This may at times include enharmonically respelling notes like B
4
, C
2
, E
4
,
and F
2
(although these notes sometimes will be used).

For the purposes of this text, we will assume the bass note is the root 11)
when analyzing chords. While slash chords (E/C, for example) are used
in jazz, this chapter is meant as an introduction to the fundamentals of
jazz harmony and therefore will not include the use of slash chords.
31.2 Chord Symbol Specifics
“6” versus “13” rule: label the 6th of a chord “6” only if the 7th is not
present; if the 7th is present, label the 6th as “13”
“11” versus “sus” (“sus” means “4”): label the 4th of a chord “sus” only if
the 3rd is not present; if the 3rd is present, label the 4th an “11” (C7sus
has C–F–G–B
2
). (There is an exception to this in more advanced jazz
theory, which is not within the purview of this text.)
3.
2
5 versus
4
11: If the chord has a normal 5th (C–E–G–B
2
–F
4
), call the F
4
a “
4
11” (because you won’t have a chord with a regular and altered 5th
at the same time). Otherwise, you can call the F
4
of C–E–B
2
–F
4
a “

31.3 Altered Dominant Seventh Chords
Typically, a dominant seventh chord is consideredalteredif either or both
the 5th or 9th are chromatically raised or lowered. (“G7alt” might mean a G7
with both an altered 5th and 9th, but is vague in that it doesn’t specify how
the 5th and 9th are chromatically altered.)
Root, 3rd, and 7th of dominant seventh chord remain unchanged.
5th may be raised or lowered (
4
5 or
2
5, which can also be written with
pluses and minuses as+5 or –5) and can be respelled enharmonically (the
4
5 of a C7
4
5 could be written as an A
2
instead of G
4
) for ease of reading
because the chromatic spelling agrees with B
2
(the 7th of the chord)—it
is easier to read a chord where the accidentals agree (all sharps or all
flats).
9th may be raised or lowered (
4
9 or
2
9, which can also be written in the
lead–sheet symbol as +9 or –9). The
4
9 is often spelled enharmonically
on the staff as
2
10 for ease of reading; therefore, a dominant seventh chord
with a
4
9 will appear to have both a major and minor 3rd (C–E–G–B
2
–E
2
).
You may be tempted to call such a chord a minor chord with a
2
11, but
2
11 is not used because it is the major third of a chord.
420 CHAPTER 31. INTRODUCTION TO JAZZ THEORY
Both alterations of 5 and 9 may occur simultaneously (±9/±5).
5.
2
13 is the enharmonic equivalent of the
4
In this text,
4
5 is preferred
to
2
13, but you will see both on lead sheets. Also,
2
13 implies that the
unaltered 5th occurs in the chord, while
4
5 does not.

If you are composing or arranging and want to know when to use altered
chords, know that dominant sevenths are usually altered (with altered 5th or
9th or both) when they have dominant function (i.e., when the root is going
to resolve down by a fifth). Dominant sevenths are often unaltered when they
have tonic function, i.e., the first chord in a blues.

Figure 31.4.8:Other chords
One finds that almost any combination of triad or seventh chord plus any
alteration or combination of alterations is possible.
31.5 How to Write Jazz Chords
To write a jazz chord after being given a lead–sheet symbol, begin with all of
the major notes up to the 13th.
Let’s work through this with the following label: Dm∆11.
Dm means D–F–A. The∆11 means there is a major 7th, regular 9th, and
regular 11th, not that there is a major 11th. Remember, D11 would mean a
D7 chord with the 9 and 11 (all chord members up to the 11th—D, F
4
, A, C,
422 CHAPTER 31. INTRODUCTION TO JAZZ THEORY
E, G). D∆11 would mean a D∆7 chord with all members up to the 11 (D,
F
4
, A, C
4
, E, G).

"Dm" means D minor triad
"Δ" means Δ 7
"11" means 7, 9, and 11 are present
Let’s try this with another chord: E7
(
(^411)
(^49)
(^45)
)
.
E7 means we have E–G
4
–B–D. When we look at the altered notes, we see
4
5, so we add a B
4
, then change it to a C
6
because that agrees chromatically
with the 7th, D. When we add
4
9, we add F
5
, which looks overly complicated,
so we enharmonically respell it as G
6
, which agrees chromatically with the D
(7th) and C (
4
5). The
4
11 can be an A
4
, an augmented 2nd above the G (the
4
9), or we can respell it as a B
2

. Both A
4
and B
2
are acceptable, although

the upper notes of D–G–B
2
form a G minor triad and therefore are easy to
sightread.

31.6 How to Analyze Jazz Chords
To analyze a jazz chord, on scratch paper write out all themajorchord mem-
bers up to the 13th. These include the major 3rd, perfect 5th, major 7th,
major 9th, perfect 11th, and major 13th.

Work through each step (see the example below). Compare this chord to
the scratch paper version with all the major notes up to the 13th. We have an
E
2
dominant 7th chord. The G
2
can’t be the minor third because we already
have a G
6
. If we consider the G
2
enharmonically as an F
4
, we see we have a
4
9,

which we noted earlier is often spelled as
2
10 so as to agree chromatically with
the
2
The A is the 11th, but it is an A
6
, so it is a
4
11. It is not
2
5 because we
would not have both a perfect 5th and altered 5th in the same chord. There
is no C in the chord, so there isn’t a 13th.

424 CHAPTER 31. INTRODUCTION TO JAZZ THEORY
We notice we don’t have an A, and we remember that we might have a sus
chord where the 4 (or sus4) substitutes for the 3rd. We see we have a B
2
, which
confirms this. We also do not see a C, but we remember that it is common to
omit the 5th in a chord (see Incomplete Chords). Therefore we have F–B
2
–E
2
,
making an F7sus chord. When we examine for upper structure notes (the 9,
11, and 13), we find a G
2
(the
2
9 of the chord) and a D (the 13). Remember,
the B
2
is the sus (the 4th), not the 11th, because we have no 3rd (see 11 versus
Sus).
The final label is F13sus(
2
9).
“F13” means we have root, 3rd, 5th,
2
7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th. “Sus” is
a modifier that means we have the 4th, which eliminates the 3rd as well as
the 11th because “sus” and 11 refer the same note (B
2
). “
2
9” means the 9th is
lowered chromatically.
31.7 Jazz Chord Voicings
In this section we will define guide tones and learn about two types of jazz
chord voicings.
31.7.1 Guide Tones
Guide Tonesare the 3rd and 7th of a chord. In any circle of fifths progressions
(including ii–V–I and iii–vi–ii–V) the guide tones move by step.

etc.) with the bass note in the left hand and the guide tones (3rd and 7th) in
the right hand and observe how the 3rd and 7th are the same for bass notes a
tritone from each other.

Also, you can play through the circle of fifths alternating between 7(13)
chords and 7(

2
7(13)–E

descending chromatically. This can be repeated with all of the bass notes a
tritone away (starting on F

for all the chords.

31.7.2 Jazz Chord Voicings
In this section we will examine two categories of voicings.
The first category (“spread” voicings) has 5–note chords with the root,
3rd, and 7th as the lowest notes with other chord members voiced above,
often in the interval of a fourth or fifth. (The root will always be the
lowest note, while the 3rd can be voiced above or below the 7th).
The second category (“close” voicings) has 5–note chords with the bass
note in the left hand and the other four notes in “close position” in the
right hand, usually with the 7th or 3rd of the chord as the lowest note
in the right hand.

Some chords (like sus chords) do not have a 3rd, and some do not have or a
7th (like C

). In those cases, voice the sus4 like you would the 3rd, and
likewise voice the 6th as you would the 7th.

31.8 Standard Chord Progressions
In this section we will focus only on the ii–V–I progression and the iii–vi–ii–V
progression. Both were already mentioned in Section 9.3.
31.8.1 II–V–I
The II–V–I is one of most common progressions in jazz, especially in tunes
like “Autumn Leaves,” “What Is This Thing Called Love,” “Tune–Up,” “Pent
Up House,” “Lady Bird,” and “Firm Roots,” to name just a few. In major the
progression is Dmin9–G9(13)–C∆9. In minor it is Dmin7(
2
5)–G7alt–Cm
6
9
.

Figure 31.8.2:The II–V–I Progression in Minor
31.8.2 III–VI–II–V
The iii–vi–ii–V progression is called aturnaroundbecause it replaces the
static harmony of the I chord in the last two measures of a tune with harmonic
motion that leads to the I chord that will occur upon repetition to the top of
the form. This also applies to the I–VI–II–V progression.
One can modify a iii–vi–ii–V turnaround so all four chords are dominant
seventh chords: III
7
–VI
7
–II
7
–V
7
(or V
7
/vi–V
7
/ii–V
7
/V–V
7
—E
7
–A
7
–D
7
–G

in lead sheet symbols). Turnarounds made solely of dominant seventh chords
can them employ tritone substitutions (substituting a dominant seventh chord
a tritone away because they have the same guide tones). For example, E
7
–A
7
–D
7
–G
7
becomes E
7
E
27
–D
7
D
27
.

31.8.3 The Blues Progression
Below are two choruses of a common jazz version of the blues progression.
The first chorus uses the first category of voicings (“spread” voicings) while the
second chorus uses the second category (“close” voicings with the 3rd or 7th as
the lowest note).
Notice that the voicings for the A
7
(
4
9
4
5
)
and E
2
9
( 13 ) are identical (not
counting the roots) because the E
2
9
( 13 ) is a tritone substitution for the
A
7
(
4
9
4
5
)
. The same is true for the G

7
(
4
9
4
5
)
and the D
2
9
( 13 ). The Roman
numerals below the staves are simplified.

Notice that the voice leading is very smooth for each part with the exception
of the bass line. All voices move by step or by 3rd.
31.9 Scales
In this section on scales, our primary concern will be understanding how
scales relate to corresponding chords in order to allow one to improvise a jazz
solo. Similarly, understanding chord–scale relationships can allow one to write
chordal solos (like a sax soli or shout chorus in a jazz ensemble piece) where
non-chord tones come from the corresponding scale.
31.9.1 The Blues Scale
Theblues scaleis identical to the minor pentatonic scale (

except with an added

Figure 31.9.2:Jack Bruce and Eric Clapton, “Sunshine of Your Love”
In the blues scale, the
2 ˆ
5 and
2 ˆ
3 are considered to be “blue notes” because
they are not chord tones (of a major triad or dominant 7th chord). Blue notes
31.9. SCALES 429
are commonly used in jazz and popular music.
In terms of using the blues scale as a soloist, you will find that some players
use the blues scale over any and every chord, and that listeners’ ears often find
this acceptable.
31.9.2 The Bebop Scale
The bebop scale (known more specifically as the “bebop dominant” scale in
jazz theory texts) is identical to the Mixolydian scale except is has an added
↑
ˆ
7. The added chromatic note (↑
ˆ
7 ) occurs in descending passages (from
ˆ
8 –
ˆ
7
2 ˆ
7 ) as a chromatic passing tone. The bebop scale is most often used over the
dominant 7th chord. In the most rudimentary form of improvising, one can
use the bebop scale in descending eighth notes beginning on the downbeat of
a measure, starting on the root, 3rd, 5th, or 7th.

Table 31.9.4:Table of Scales
31.10How to Determine Chord–Scale Relationships
To discover a chord–scale relationship for almost any chord, write all of the

notes of the chord (including upper extensions and altered notes), then fill

in the thirds with the most logical choices,avoiding augmented seconds and

consecutive half–steps.

In the example below, we determine the scale that best fits G∆
7
(
4
11 )by
doing the following:

Identify the notes in the chord
Write all chord tones as a scale within the span of an octave
Fill in any gaps, avoiding augmented 2nds and consecutive half steps
Analyze the resulting scale

31.10.1 List of Chord–Scale Relationships

Below is a list of common chord–scale relationships. When there are two scales

listed for a single chord, it is because the chord has a minor third that can

be filled with half–step then whole–stepor whole–step then half–step. This

knowledge of chord–scale relationships ultimately becomes second nature to an

improvising jazz musician.

Table 31.10.3:List of Chord–Scale Relationships
This list is not exhaustive. Follow the process above (“How to Determine
Chord–Scale Relationships”) for chords not listed in this list.
Additionally, it is often important to look at the relationship of a chord to
the overall key of a tune to determine the appropriate scale. For example, the
Fmin
7
at the beginning of “All The Things You Are” by Jerome Kern is the
vi
7
chord in A
2
major, in which case it would be inappropriate to play an F
Dorian scale because the D
6
would conflict with the D
2
in the key signature.
One would play an F natural minor (or Aeolian) scale instead.

Figure 31.11.2: Four–Part Harmonization of the Bebop Scale in Minor
Notice that all of the non–tonic chords are vii
◦ 7
chords in various inversions.
One hears a similar approach to harmonizing a scale (though without the
fully–diminished seventh chords as passing chords) in the following example.

Jazz Theory: Day Three
434 CHAPTER 31. INTRODUCTION TO JAZZ THEORY
Voice lead the following progressions. Remember to spell notes enhar-
monically when necessary. In the first example, use “close” voicing,
keeping all the upper notes as close together as possible. In the sec-
ond example, use Root–3rd–7th or Root–7th–3rd always for the lowest
three voices, then realize the rest of the lead sheet symbol with the
upper two parts (“spread” voicing). Use Root–3rd–6th for 6th chords
and Root–4th–7th for sus chords. You may need to omit the 5th to
maintain five parts throughout.

Chapter 32

Impressionism and Extended

Tonality

32.1 Impressionism
Impressionismis associated with Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel in
France, Ottorino Respighi in Italy, Charles Tomlinson Griffes in America, and
Frederick Delius in England. We will focus on just three techniques found
in the music of Debussy and Ravel: (1) the use of modes, (2) the use of up-
per–extensions above the 7th in chord construction in tertian harmonies (9ths,
11ths, and 13ths, which we saw in the chapter on jazz), and (3) parallelism,
also known as “planing.”
1.Use of modes. Composers such as Debussy and Ravel sometimes wrote
in the church modes (Phrygian, Lydian, etc.—see Scales) as an alter-
native to the heavily chromatic music of Richard Wagner (listen to the
influential Prelude to Act I of Wagner’sTristan und Isolde).
(a) The first movement of Debussy’s String Quartet in G minor, Op.
10, begins in Phrygian mode. Notice that the seventh chord that
occurs on the
ˆ
5 scale degree is half–diminished in Phrygian. (The
penultimate chord in this example is not in Phrygian mode.)

2.Use of upper extensions in chords. Debussy and Ravel used chords con-
taining ninths, elevenths, and thirteenths, sometimes with chromatic al-
terations to those upper extensions.
(a) In bar 15 of Debussy’s “Clair de lune” from hisSuite bergamasque,
Debussy uses an E

melody.

3.Use of parallelism(also known as “planing”). In contrast to the prohibi-
tion against parallel fifths and octaves in traditional voice leading, both
Debussy and Ravel would take a chord voicing and move all voices in
parallel motion.
(a) InPavane pour une infante défunte, Ravel writes dominant 9th
chords in parallel motion in bar 27.

Figure 32.1.10:Debussy,Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun
442 CHAPTER 32. IMPRESSIONISM AND EXTENDED TONALITY
32.2 Pandiatonicism
Pandiatonicismrefers to the use of all diatonic notes without the need for
scale degrees or harmonies to progress or function tonally (V doesn’t need to
progress to I,
ˆ
7 doesn’t need to resolve to
ˆ
8 , etc.). One often hears it as
a wash of notes from the major scale, or as chords made of non–traditional
combinations of notes from a major scale, often with at least one interval of a
2nd in a chord voicing.
In the first example, notice how Stravinsky creates a wash of sound from
the notes of the major scale.

Figure 32.2.1: Stravinsky,Petrushka, Fourth Tableau:The Shrovetide Fair
(Toward Evening)
In the second example, Copland uses non–traditional pandiatonic chord
shapes in non–functional harmonic progression.

The third example is similar to the first, with Copland creating a wash
of sound from the notes of the major scale, with no regard to the dissonant
intervals occurring in counterpoint.

32.3 Quartal, Quintal, and Secundal Harmony
Quartal harmonyrefers to chords stacked entirely (or mostly) in fourths.

Quintal harmonyrefers to chords stacked entirely (or mostly) in fifths.Se-

cundal harmonyrefers to chords stacked entirely (or mostly) in seconds.

Contrast these concepts with the tertian (stacked in thirds) harmony we’ve

encountered in the majority of this text. Alternative methods of stacking

chords became more common after 1900 as composers sought ways to innovate

and break with the past.

The next three examples demonstrate quartal harmony.

32.4 Polychords
Apolychordtypically consists of two triads sounding simultaneously. A poly-

chord could also consist of two seventh chords, or a seventh chord and triad.

Additionally, a polychord could conceivably consist of more than two triads or

seventh chords, since the prefix “poly” means “many.”

Perhaps the most famous polychord is the “Rite of Spring chord,” an E
2
7
chord sounding over an F
2
major chord, which occurs during the “Dance of the

Adolescents.”

33.1 Set Theory
33.1 Set Theory

Set theoryis the analytical technique we will use to analyze expressionist mu-

sic. The primary composers associated with expressionism are Arnold Schoen-

berg (1874–1951), Anton Webern (1883–1945), and Alban Berg (1885–1935).

In this text, we will associateatonal music—music that avoids traditional

harmonies and scales—with expressionism. Instead of scales and chords, inter-

vals are the building blocks of Expressionist music. Although composers began

writing atonal music in 1908, there was no widely–accepted systematic ana-

lytical approach that could show relationships between different pieces until

Allen Forte published his seminalThe Structure of Atonal Musicin 1973, in

which Forte applied set theory mathematics to music. However, our approach

to normal form and prime form will follow the slightly–modified approach set

out by John Rahn in hisBasic Atonal Theory(1980), which is the approach

followed by Joseph Straus in his well–known and widely–usedIntroduction to

Post–Tonal Theory.

33.1.1 Atonal Music

Listen to the following example by Anton Webern.

Figure 33.1.1:Webern, 5 movements for string quartet, No. 3.Sehr bewegt

Of the 208 sets that exist, only 6 are different between the Forte and Rahn methods for
prime form. See https://www.mta.ca/pc-set/pc-setnew/pages/pc−table/packed.html.

449
450 CHAPTER 33. SET THEORY
Gone are the triadic structures we have studied throughout this text. In
this music, intervals are paramount. Let us examine the intervals we find.

Look at the intervallic structure of the first two chords,
2
not including
the C
4
in the cello part. We see the interval of an augmented 5th below
the interval of a minor 3rd in the first chord, and the interval of a minor
sixth below the interval of a minor 3rd in the second chord. Notice that the
names we use for intervals carry tonal implications. An augmented 5th would
function differently than a minor 6th, but in atonal music, these intervals have
the same sound, are separated by the same number of half steps, and have no
tonal implications (they don’t have to resolve any particular way). Therefore,
analysts like Allen Forte used integers to represent pitches and intervals to
remove the tonal implications of staff notation.
33.1.2 Integer Notation for Pitches
One notable trait of set theory is that we will represent pitches with integers,
as seen in the table below.

Integer: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
It may be helpful to remember that the C major triad (C, E, and G) consists
of integers 0, 4, and 7.
Integer notation of pitches means we assumeenharmonic equivalenceof
notes. For example, D, C
5
, and E
3
are all represented as pitch integer 2. We
also assumeoctave equivalence, which itself presumes the notion ofpitch
class. When we say Beethoven’s first symphony is in C, we refer not to any
specific C (C 1 , C 2 , C 3 , etc.), but to the concept of the pitch class C, which
includes any and all Cs. Therefore, you would label the note C as pitch class
0, no matter the register in which it occurs.
33.1.3 Integer Notation for Intervals
We will also measure intervals using integers, with each interval represented by
the number ofsemitones(half steps) it contains. The following table contains
the number of semitones in each interval.
2
Some authors call atonal chords “sonorities” to differentiate them from chords in the
traditional triadic sense; we will continue to use “chord” in this text.

m3 3 M6 9
M3 4 m7 10
P4 5 M7 11
TT 6 P8 12
Table 33.1.2:Interval Integers
33.1.4 Pitch–Class Sets
In atonal music we will analyze sets of pitch classes, hence the term “pitch–class
set analysis.” Let us return to the example by Webern, this time with integers
for pitches and for intervals.

pitch-class numbers
The first chord consists of E
2
, B, and D, or pitch integers 3, 11, and 2. If
we examine the intervallic distance, we find 8 semitones between pitch integers
3 and 11, and 3 semitones between 11 and 2. Note that we are working in
a modulo 12 system, meaning we restart our numbering after 11 (0, 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.). We are used to modulo 12 thinking
since we all deal with clocks. If a meeting ran from 11am to 2pm, it lasted 3
hours. Therefore, an interval from pitch integer 11 to pitch integer 2 spans 3
semitones. The second chord has the same intervallic construction.
Now, let’s look at the two chords in the second half of the third measure.

We see right away that the second of these chords has the same construction
as the two chords we examined the in earlier examples (a minor 6th below a
minor 3rd). However, the first chord in this example (G
4
, C, A, or 8, 0, 9) ap-
pears to be different, with a diminished 4th from G
4
to C (an interval spanning
4 semitones, enharmonically equivalent to a major 3rd) below the interval of a
major 6th from C to A (spanning 9 semitones). To see the relationship of this
chord to the others, we need to learn about normal form and prime form.
452 CHAPTER 33. SET THEORY
33.2 Normal Form
Normal formrepresents the notes of a pitch–class set (as they occur in the
music) in their most compact form.
To determine normal form, follow these steps:
Put the notes of a pitch–class set from a piece of music in ascending
numeric order (like a scale). Eliminate any duplicate pitches.

Ascending numeric order:
Examine every possible ascending “scale” ordering of the notes until you
find the most compact form—that is, the one that spans the smallest
interval from lowest to highest note.

The Forte method for determining prime form would have measured from first to second
note to break the tie instead of first to penultimate note, which is method used Rahn’sBasic
Atonal Theory.
33.3. PRIME FORM 453
Normal form is written in square brackets with commas. The normal
form found in step 3 above was [11, 2, 3, 7].
33.3 Prime Form
Whereas normal form deals with the exact pitches as they occur in the music,
prime formis usually a transposition and possibly an inversion of the normal
form to its most essential form, much in the way an E
2
major triad in second
inversion belongs to the category “major triad,” or a G
7
/F belongs to the more
general idea “dominant seventh chord.” Perhaps because of the primacy of C
in music theory—many ideas are demonstrated in their relation to the C major
scale—all prime forms are transposed to and start on C (pitch integer 0).
Following is the process for determining prime form.
Transpose the normal form—[11, 2, 3, 7] from the normal form example
in the previous section—so it starts on C (pitch integer 0): 0, 3, 4, 8

Write this inverted form in ascending form (4, 8, 9, 0), then do one of
the following:
(a) If there were no ties when determining normal form, proceed to the
step 4.
(b) If there were ties, put this inverted version through every ascending
“scale” ordering to determine which is the most compact form from
first note to penultimate note. In the example below, we see that
the second ordering (the “tie loser” from normal form) is the most
compact of the reorderings of the inverted normal form.

We see that the third set has the same prime form—(014)—as the other
sets in the opening measures of Webern’s Op 5, No. 3. Prime form can allow
us to see relationships that may not be apparent on the surface of the music.
33.3.2 Segmentation
What about the C
4
in the cello part? Should it be included with the three
notes from the chords? Will another similarity be revealed? Segmentation
is the term for “segmenting” or determining which notes to group together
and analyze in a passage. Usually, segmentation is based on the music—notes
sounding together as a chord, or notes in a melodic line. However, analysts
may look at every possible combination of notes to search for deeper layers of
connection.
Below, we examine the first two chords with the C
4
included in each.

The prime form of the second set, when including the C
4
from the cello, is
(0236).
We do not see any relationship between these first two sets after including
the C
4
with each three–note set. One doesn’t know this until one examines
this new segmentation.
33.4 Interval Vector
Aninterval vector(also known as “Interval Class Content”) is a list of every
possible interval occurring in a pitch–class set. Calculating an interval vector
is rather straightforward. First, after determing normal form, measure from
the first note to all the other notes. Second, measure from the second note
to all higher notes (not back or down to the first note). Continue measuring
from each successive note to the notes following and you will have completed
the interval vector.
Before demonstrating this, it is important to discuss the term “interval
class.” Aninterval class(abbreviated “ic”) is the shortest distance between
two notes measured in semitones. In the example below, C up to A is a major
6th. However, the shortest distance between C and A (measure downward) is
a minor 3rd. Therefore, the largest interval class is 6 (the tritone), because
any perfect 5th (for example, from C to G) has an interval class of 5 (a perfect
4th) because Cdownto G is a perfect 4th.

With this in mind, let’s complete an interval vector of the a half–diminished
7th chord on G. First, arrange the notes in ascending order, then measure from
the first note to the second, third, and fourth notes.

Finally, measure from the third note to the fourth note, and the interval
vector will be complete. We add one tally for ic4; the complete interval vector
is 012011, which tells us a half–diminished chord has zero half steps, one major
2nd (shown in this voicing as a minor 7th), two minor 3rds, no major 3rds,
one perfect 4th (shown in this voicing as perfect 5th), and one tritone.

An interval vector always contains 6 digits. When an interval class does
not occur (the way the minor second did not occur in the G half–diminished
seventh chord), place a zero in the column for that interval class.
33.5 Forte Numbers
When Allen Forte created a catalog of every possible 3–, 4–, 5–, 6–, 7–, 8–,
and 9–note set in Appendix 1 ofThe Structure of Atonal Music, he labeled
each prime form with two numbers separated by a hyphen. His labels (3–1,
458 CHAPTER 33. SET THEORY

3–2, etc.) are now known as “Forte numbers,” and are seen in the tables in the

Lists of Set Classes, which include prime forms and interval vectors as well.

33.5.1 Z–Relations

“Z” in a set label (for example, 4–Z29) stands for “zygotic” (“twinned”), and is

used when different prime forms (for example, 4–Z29 and 4–Z15 have the same

interval vector—111111).

33.6 Lists of Set Classes
Below are lists of all set classes with prime form, Forte number, and interval

vectors shown. Allen Forte published the original list of set classes inThe

Structure of Atonal Musicin 1973. These lists use prime forms as calculated

using the Rahn method. Prime forms of sets are ordered from most packed

to the left to least packed to the left, as is found in the list of set classes in

both John Rahn’sBasic Atonal Theory and Joseph Straus’Introduction to

Post–Tonal Theory. Sets are listed across from theircomplements. When

taken together, complements can complete the 12–note chromatic scale when

correctly transposed (and sometimes inverted).

33.7 Transposition (T
n
)

Transposition is an operation performed as Tn, wherenis the number of

semitonesupa set is transposed. For example, [1, 2, 4, 6] at T 4 is [5, 6, 8, 10].

)
[ 1 2 4 6 ] [ 5 6 8 10 ]
When working in a modulo 12 system, remember that numbers larger than
12 have to be reduced to a number smaller than 12 by subtracting 12 from the

larger number. For example, 6, 8, 10, 11 at T 9 would result in 15, 17, 18, 20,

which, after subtracting 12 from each number, results in 3, 5, 6, 8.

33.8 Inversion (T
n
I)

Inverting a set using T
n
I is a compound operation. The first step is to invert

each note below C using C as an axis. For example, E is a major 3rd above C,

so E would invert to A
2
, a major thirdbelowC.

C is axis of

I
M3 above C inverts to M3 below C at T 0 I
The second step of inversion is to apply the T
n
interval. So, to calculate T
3
I
for the note E, one would first invert E to A
2
(this is T
0
I),thentranspose the

A
2
up 3 semitones to B. (Theorist Joseph Straus simplifies the nomenclature

to I
n
instead of T
n
I, but the outcome remains the same.)

Let’s try inverting a pitch–class set, applying T
7
I to [2, 4, 5] (or D, E, and
F). Inverting the notes to the opposite side of C using C as an axis yields pitch

numbers 10, 8, and 7 (or B
2
, A
2
, and G), which in ascending order is 7, 8, and

Then transposing [7, 8, 10] at T 7 raises each note 7 semitones, resulting in
[2, 3, 5] (or D, E
2
, and F).

To determinenof TnI for two inversionally–related sets, write the second set

backward and add the notes of the two sets together. Each sum will equaln.

Let’s use our two sets from the previous example above: [2, 4, 5] and [2, 3, 5].

466 CHAPTER 33. SET THEORY

Chapter 34

Serialism

Serialism is a term that encompasses the twelve–tone technique of Schoenberg,

Webern, and Berg, who were the major figures we associated with expres-

sionism and atonality in the previous chapter on set theory. We will begin

by discussing classic twelve–tone serialism before discussing non–twelve–tone

serialism.

34.1 Twelve–Tone Technique
images/video-452.jpg
YouTube:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQHR_Z8XVvI
Figure 34.1.1:Arnold Schoenberg, Suite for Piano, Op. 25
In a twelve–tone composition, every note can be accounted for as being a
member of the original series or one of its permutations, providing unity to the

piece as a whole. Additionally, a twelve–tone series is a repository of intervals

and can be seen as an outgrowth of atonal music with its emphasis on interval

over chord or scale. The basic premises of twelve–tone music are as follows:

All twelve notes of the chromatic scale must occur
No note can be repeated in the series until the other 11 notes of the
chromatic scale have occurred (exceptions include direct repetition of a
note, trills, and tremolos)
The series can be inverted, retrograded, and the inversion can be retro-
graded
The order of notes in a series remains fixed, without reordering.
467
468 CHAPTER 34. SERIALISM
34.1.1 Row Forms
A twelve–tone series is also commonly called a twelve–tone “row,” and we will
use the term “row” throughout this chapter.
The four types of row forms used in twelve–tone technique are prime (P),
retrograde (R), inversion (I), and retrograde inversion (RI). Theprimeis the
original row. Theretrogradeis the prime form backward. Theinversionis
the original row with all intervals in the row inverted (going in the opposite
direction of the original). Finally, theretrograde inversionis the inversion
retrograded (and therefore might have more appropriately been labeled “in-
version retrograded” since “retrograde inversion” sounds like it refers to the
backward form inverted instead of the inverted form backward).

Inversion = Prime with intervals inverted Retrograde Inversion = Inversion backward
34.1.2 Transposition Numbers
Each row form can be transposed to start on any note from the chromatic scale.
We will use the same pitch integers as in set theory. For primes and inversions,
we will use P and I accompanied by a pitch integer to specify the starting note.
For example, P
0
is a twelve–tone row starting on C (pitch integer 0), P
3
is a
twelve–tone row starting on E
2
, and so forth. The same is the case for row
forms like I
2
(starting on D), I
5
(starting on F), on so forth.

34.2 Determining Row Forms
To determine a row form’s permutation and transposition, examine the inter-
vallic composition of each row form. In the example below, each row statement
34.2. DETERMINING ROW FORMS 469
is based on the prime form of the row in the previous sections.

In examining the first few notes in the upper staff in the short musical
excerpt below, we see an ascending minor 3rd followed by a descending major
2nd. The only row form to start with these intervals is the retrograde. To
determine the transposition number, we look at the last note (the 12th note)
in the first measure in the upper staff (A
2
), which gives us the transposition
level (pitch integer 8), meaning this is R 8. The second measure in the upper
staff begins with a minor 3rd followed by an ascending major 2nd, making this
a retrograde inversion. The 12th note in this measure is an E (pitch integer 4),
making this RI 4. In the first measure of the lower staff, we find a descending
minor 2nd followed by a descending perfect 4th, making this I 11. Finally, the
second measure in the lower staff begins on C
4
with an ascending minor 2nd
followed by an ascending perfect 4th, making this P 1.

34.3 Writing Row Forms
To write specified row forms from a given prime form, write all four versions

of the row: P, R, I, and RI. Then, simply transpose the specified row form to

the correct pitch, remembering that P and I forms start on the pitch integer

(P 3 and I 3 would begin on E
2
, for example) while R and RI formsendon the

pitch integer (R 3 and RI 3 would end on E
2
).

To write I 9 and RI 5 if given P 0 :
Write all four row forms (P, R, I, RI).

34.4 Twelve–Tone Matrix
One tool analysts create to analyze a twelve–tone composition is a twelve–tone

matrix, which shows all 48 row forms in a 12 by 12 grid. Below is a matrix for

the row we’ve been dealing with in this chapter.

From there, you can write the transpositions of the prime form, given the
starting notes in the left column. One would continue with each transposition

of the prime form until the matrix is complete.

34.5 Row Form Presentation in Music
In a piece of music, twelve–tone rows may not be clearly presented. One manner

of presentation is overlap, where the final note of one row is the starting note

of the next row.

An analyst would first attempt to find a clear presentation of a twelve–tone
row somewhere in the composition in order to analyze harmonies.

34.6 Non–Twelve–Tone Serialism
Serialism also includes music that is not twelve–tone but does use a series of
notes that maintains its order and employs inversion, retrograde, and retro-
grade inversion of the series. An example is found in Stravinsky’s Septet from
34.7. PRACTICE EXERCISES 473

Figure 34.6.4: Normal form of the 8 pitches in the series from Stravinsky’s
Septet
Such a series could imply E or A as a tonal center. Note that Stravinsky’s
Septet is not strictly serial but contains serial elements. Such an example
shows us that serialism can be employed in ways other than the strict, original
twelve–tone version.

Minimalism

The rise of minimalism in the 1960s was a significant development in art music.

While four artists are typically associated with minimalism—La Monte Young

(b. 1935), Terry Riley (b. 1935), Phillip Glass (b. 1937), Steve Reich (b.

1936)—we will focus on just two techniques in this chapter. The first, additive

minimalism, is associated with the early minimalist pieces by Philip Glass.

The second, phase shifting, is associated with Steve Reich.

35.1 Additive Minimalism
In Philip Glass’s version of additive minimalism as found at the beginning

of his compositionTwo Pages(1969), he adds a repetition of a pattern but

subtracts the final note in the repetition. Each addition to the pattern is

another repetition with the final note of the previous repetition subtracted,

as can be seen in the example below. (Note: The music notation below is

a transcription and analysis meant to show the additive process and is not

necessarily how the music is written in the score.)

To hear additive process in Glass’s well–knownEinstein on the Beach, listen
to the following minute of music from Act 1, Scene 1, “Train.” Each chord in
a five–chord cadential progression is gradually lengthened by adding to the
number of subdivisions given to each chord.

35.2 Phase Shifting
Minimalist composer Steve Reich conceived of phase shifting in his early work
in tape music, noting that tape loops of slightly differing lengths containing the
same idea went slowly out of phase and very gradually back into phase when
they were repeated incessantly (seeIt’s Gonna Rainfrom 1965 andCome Out
from 1966). Reich applied this phase–shifting process to live performance in
Piano Phase(1967),Violin Phase(1967), andClapping Music(1972).

Figure 35.2.2:Reich,Piano Phase(1967)
During the phase–shifting process, one can think of the lower voices in the
examples above as going through rotation. The example below shows rotation

of a five–note pattern. The pattern rotates one note to the left, meaning the

second note begins the pattern on the second line, the third note begins the

pattern on the third line, etc., until the first note starts the pattern again to

complete the phase–shifting process.

rotating pattern one note
to the right. 2nd note begins
pattern, then the 3rd note begins
the pattern, until the 1st notestarts the
pattern again to complete the process.
Figure 35.2.3:Rotation demonstrated with a five–note pattern
In a piece of music, the process would play out similar to the manner
below, where one part maintains the original pattern while the second goes
out of phase by continually rotating the original pattern one note to the left.
InPiano Phase, Reich has the second pianist gradually increase in speed so
the patterns go slowly out of phase, while inClapping Music, Reich has the
musicians change to the next rotation on the downbeat of a measure, without
gradually speeding up.

Two–Reprise Continuous Ternary, if looking at the proportion, or
Two–Reprise Continuous Rounded Binary, if you interpret the first two
notes in bar 13 as being built from the first two notes in bar 1—and if
you are considering that Mozart, as a Classical–era composer, is likely to
compose a rounded binary. Two–Reprise Continuous Balanced Binary is a
label that describes that the endings of the halves are the same, but doesn’t
take into account the return of the opening material in bar 21.

GNU Free Documentation Li-

cense

Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

Copyright©2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
http://www.fsf.org/

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

PREAMBLE. The purpose of this License is to make a manual, text-
book, or other functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom:

to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or

without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily,

this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their

work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative works of
the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements

the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free

software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free soft-
ware, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should

come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But

this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual

work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.

We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction

or reference.

APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS. This License applies to
any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the

copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License.

Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,

to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The “Document”, below,

refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and

is addressed as “you”. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute

the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications

and/or translated into another language.

A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
519
520 APPENDIX B. GNU FREE DOCUMENTATION LICENSE

the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or

authors of the Document to the Document’s overall subject (or to related mat-

ters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.

(Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Sec-

tion may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter

of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,

commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that

the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above

definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.

The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not

identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Doc-

ument is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5

words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public,

that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text

editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for draw-

ings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to

text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable

for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file

format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or

discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image

format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy

that is not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML

using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript

or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image for-

mats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats

that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or

XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available,

and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word

processors for output purposes only.

The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires

to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title

page as such, “Title Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance

of the work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies of the
Document to the public.

A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text

that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific

section name mentioned below, such as “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”,

“Endorsements”, or “History”.) To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when

you modify the Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ”

according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers

are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards

521
disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers

may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.

VERBATIM COPYING. You may copy and distribute the Document
in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this

License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies

to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other

conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical

measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies

you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange

for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also

follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
may publicly display copies.

COPYING IN QUANTITY. If you publish printed copies (or copies
in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering

more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you

must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover

Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back

cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher

of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of

the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the

covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they

preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated

as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you
should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover,

and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along

with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-

network location from which the general network-using public has access to

download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent

copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you

must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque

copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus ac-

cessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you

distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that

edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Doc-
ument well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a

chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

MODIFICATIONS. You may copy and distribute a Modified Version
of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided

that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the

Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution

and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In

addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that
of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if
there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You
522 APPENDIX B. GNU FREE DOCUMENTATION LICENSE

may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities re-
sponsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all
of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version,
as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to
the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving
the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this
License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and
required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title, and add to it
an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of
the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section
Entitled “History” in the Document, create one stating the title, year,
authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then
add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous
sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public
access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.
These may be placed in the “History” section. You may omit a network
location for a work that was published at least four years before the
Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to
gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and
tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications
given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their
text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not con-
sidered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”. Such a section may not be
included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled “Endorsements” or to
conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
523
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the

Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as

invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the

Modified Version’s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other

section titles.

You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains noth-
ing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties — for ex-

ample, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an

organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover

Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one

of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any

one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,

previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are

acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old

one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement

of any Modified Version.

COMBINING DOCUMENTS. You may combine the Document with
other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section

4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination

all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and

list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice,

and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are

multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make

the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses,

the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a

unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of

Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History” in
the various original documents, forming one section Entitled “History”; likewise

combine any sections Entitled “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled

“Dedications”. You must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements”.

COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS. You may make a collection
consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License,

and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with

a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the

rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other

respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it
individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into

the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding

verbatim copying of that document.

AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS. A compila-
tion of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent

524 APPENDIX B. GNU FREE DOCUMENTATION LICENSE

documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is

called an “aggregate” if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used

to limit the legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual

works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License

does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves

derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire

aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket

the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if

the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed

covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

TRANSLATION. Translation is considered a kind of modification, so
you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section

Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission
from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or

all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant

Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license

notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also

include the original English version of this License and the original versions of

those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation

and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original

version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”,
or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will

typically require changing the actual title.

TERMINATION. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute
the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt

otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will auto-

matically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from
a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until

the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)

permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by

some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated per-
manently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable

means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License

(for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to

30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses
of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If

your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a

copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE. The Free Software
Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation

License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the

present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Seehttp://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If
the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License “or

RELICENSING. “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC
Site”) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works

and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A

public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A “Massive

Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the site means any set of

copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

“CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corpora-

tion with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as

future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.

“Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in
part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this License, and
if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than

this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC,

(1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated

prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided

the MMC is eligible for relicensing.
