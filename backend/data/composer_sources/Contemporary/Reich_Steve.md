## Biography

Stephen Michael Reich
(

RYSHE
;
[

[

[

]
born October 3, 1936) is an American composer best known as a pioneer of
minimal music
in the mid to late 1960s.
[

[

Reich's work is marked by its use of
repetitive figures
, slow
harmonic rhythm
, and
canons
. Reich describes this concept in his essay "Music as a Gradual Process" by stating, "I am interested in perceptible processes. I want to be able to hear the process happening throughout the sounding music." For example, his early works experiment with phase shifting, in which one or more repeated phrases plays slower or faster than the others, causing it to go "out of phase." This creates new musical patterns in a perceptible flow.
[

]

His innovations include using
tape loops
to create
phasing
patterns, as on the early compositions
It's Gonna Rain
(1965) and
Come Out
(1966), and the use of simple, audible
processes
, as on
Pendulum Music
(1968) and
Four Organs
(1970). Works like
Drumming
(1971) and
Music for 18 Musicians
(1976), both considered landmarks of minimalism and important influences on
experimental music
,
rock
, and contemporary
electronic music
, would help entrench minimalism as a movement.
[

]
Reich's work took on a darker character in the 1980s with the introduction of historical themes as well as themes from his Jewish heritage, notably
Different Trains
(1988).

Reich's style of composition has influenced many contemporary composers and groups, especially in the United States and Great Britain. The critic Andrew Clements has suggested that Reich is one of "a handful of living composers who can legitimately claim to have altered the direction of musical history".
[

Reich was born in New York City to Jewish parents, the Broadway lyricist
June Sillman
and Leonard Reich. When he was one year old, his parents divorced, and Reich divided his time between New York and California. He is the half-brother of writer
Jonathan Carroll
.
[
10
]
He was given piano lessons as a child and describes growing up with the "middle-class favorites", having no exposure to music written before 1750 or after 1900. At the age of 14 he began to study music in earnest, after hearing music from the
Baroque period
and earlier, as well as music of the 20th century.
[
11
]
Reich studied drums with
Roland Kohloff
in order to play
jazz
. While attending
Cornell University
, he minored in music and graduated in 1957 with a B.A. in Philosophy.
[
12
]
Reich's B.A. thesis was on
Ludwig Wittgenstein
;
[
13
]
later he would set texts by that philosopher to music in
Proverb
[
14
]
(1995) and
You Are (variations)
(2006).
[
15
]

For a year following graduation, Reich studied composition privately with
Hall Overton
before he enrolled at
Juilliard
[
16
]
to work with
William Bergsma
and
Vincent Persichetti
(1958–1961). Subsequently, he attended
Mills College
in
Oakland, California
, where he studied with
Luciano Berio
and
Darius Milhaud
(1961–1963) and earned a master's degree in composition. At Mills, Reich composed
Melodica
for
melodica
and
tape
, which appeared in 1986 on the three-LP release
Music from Mills
.
[
17
]

Reich worked with the
San Francisco Tape Music Center
along with
Pauline Oliveros
,
Ramon Sender
,
Morton Subotnick
,
Phil Lesh
and
Terry Riley
.
[
18
]
He was involved with the premiere of Riley's
In C
and suggested the use of the eighth note pulse, which is now standard in performance of the piece.

Reich's early forays into composition involved experimentation with
twelve-tone composition
, but he found the rhythmic aspects of the number twelve more interesting than the pitch aspects.
[
19
]
Reich also composed film soundtracks for
Plastic Haircut
(1963),
Oh Dem Watermelons
(1965), and
Thick Pucker
(1965), three films by
Robert Nelson
. The soundtrack of
Plastic Haircut
, composed in 1963, was a short tape collage, possibly Reich's first. The
Watermelons
soundtrack used two 19th-century
minstrel tunes
as its basis, and used repeated phrasing together in a large five-part
canon
. The music for
Thick Pucker
arose from street recordings Reich made walking around San Francisco with Nelson, who filmed in black and white 16mm. This film no longer survives. A fourth film from 1965, about 25 minutes long and tentatively entitled "Thick Pucker II", was assembled by Nelson from outtakes of that shoot and more of the raw audio Reich had recorded. Nelson was not happy with the resulting film and never showed it.

Reich was influenced by fellow minimalist
Terry Riley
, whose work
In C
combines simple musical patterns, offset in time, to create a slowly shifting, cohesive whole. Reich adopted this approach to compose his first major work,
It's Gonna Rain
. Composed in 1965, the piece used a fragment of a
sermon
about the end of the world given by a Black
Pentecostal
street-preacher known as Brother Walter. Reich built on his early tape work, transferring the last three words of the fragment, "it's gonna rain!", to multiple tape loops that gradually move
out of phase
with one another.
[
20
]

The 13-minute
Come Out
(1966) uses similarly manipulated
sound collage
recordings of a single spoken line given by Daniel Hamm, one of the falsely accused
Harlem Six
, who was severely injured by police.
[
21
]
The survivor, who had been beaten, punctured a bruise on his own body to convince police to allow him to receive medical aid for his injury from the police beating. Out of Hamm's spoken line "I had to, like, open the bruise up and let some of the bruise blood come out to show them," Reich rerecorded the fragment "come out to show them" on two channels, which are initially played in unison. They quickly slip out of sync; gradually the discrepancy widens and becomes a reverberation. The two voices then split into four, looped continuously, then eight, and continues splitting until the actual words are unintelligible, leaving the listener with only the speech's rhythmic and tonal patterns.

In
Melodica
(1966), Reich applies the phase looping approach of his previous works to a musical instrument. He started by playing and recording a simple melody on a
melodica
. He then places the recording on two separate channels, and by slowly moving them out of phase creates an intricate interlocking melody. This piece is very similar to
Come Out
in rhythmic structure, and is an example of how one rhythmic process can be realized in different sounds to create two different pieces of music. Reich was inspired to compose this piece from a dream he had on May 22, 1966, and put the piece together in one day.
Melodica
was the last piece Reich composed solely for tape, and he considers it his transition from tape music to instrumental music.
[
22
]

Reich's first attempt at translating this phasing technique from recorded tape to live performance was the 1967
Piano Phase
, for two pianos. In
Piano Phase
the performers repeat a rapid twelve-note
melodic
figure, initially in unison. As one player keeps tempo with robotic precision, the other speeds up very slightly until the two parts line up again, but one sixteenth note apart. The second player then resumes the previous tempo. This cycle of speeding up and then locking in continues throughout the piece; the cycle comes full circle three times, the second and third cycles using shorter versions of the initial figure.
Violin Phase
, also written in 1967, is built on these same lines.
Piano Phase
and
Violin Phase
both premiered in a series of concerts given in New York art galleries.

A similar, lesser known example of this so-called
process music
is
Pendulum Music
(1968), which consists of the sound of several microphones swinging over the loudspeakers to which they are attached, producing
feedback
as they do so. "Pendulum Music" has never been recorded by Reich himself,
[
citation needed
]
but was introduced to rock audiences by
Sonic Youth
in the late 1990s.
[
clarification needed
]

Reich also tried to create the phasing effect in a piece "that would need no instrument beyond the human body". He found that the idea of phasing was inappropriate for the simple ways he was experimenting to make sound. Instead, he composed
Clapping Music
(1972), in which the players do not phase in and out with each other, but instead one performer keeps one line of a 12-eighth-note-long (12-quaver-long) phrase and the other performer shifts by one
eighth note
beat every 12 bars, until both performers are back in unison 144 bars later.
[
23
]

The 1967 prototype piece
Slow Motion Sound
was not performed although
Chris Hughes
performed it 27 years later as
Slow Motion Blackbird
on his Reich-influenced 1994 album
Shift
. It introduced the idea of slowing down a recorded sound until many times its original length without changing pitch or timbre, which Reich applied to
Four Organs
(1970), which deals specifically with augmentation. The piece has
maracas
playing a fast
eighth note
pulse
, while the four organs stress certain eighth notes using an 11th chord. This work therefore dealt with
repetition
and subtle rhythmic change. In contrast to Reich's typical cyclical structure,
Four Organs
is unique among his work in using a linear structure—the superficially similar
Phase Patterns
, also for four organs but without maracas, is (as the name suggests) a cyclical phase piece similar to others composed during the period.
Four Organs
was performed as part of a
Boston Symphony Orchestra
program, and was Reich's first composition to be performed in a large traditional setting.

In June 1970, Reich travelled to the
University of Ghana
to study
polyrhythmic
music for five weeks with the
Ewe
master drummer Gideon Alorwoyie.
[
24
]
From this experience, as well as
A. M. Jones
's
Studies in African Music
about the
music of the Ewe
people, Reich drew inspiration for his extensive piece
Drumming
(1970–1971), which he started to compose shortly after his return. Composed for a nine-piece percussion ensemble with female voices and
piccolo
,
Drumming
marked the beginning of a new stage in his career, for around this time he formed his ensemble,
Steve Reich and Musicians
, and increasingly concentrated on composition and performance with them. Steve Reich and Musicians was the sole ensemble to interpret his works for many years,
[
25
]
and they remain a "living laboratory" for his music.
[
26
]
The ensemble still remains active with many of its original members.
[
27
]

After
Drumming
, Reich moved on from the "phase shifting" technique that he had pioneered, and began writing more elaborate pieces. He started investigating other musical processes such as
augmentation
(the temporal lengthening of phrases and melodic fragments). In the summers of 1973 and 1974, he studied
Balinese
gamelan
semar pegulingan
and
gambang
[
28
]
(at
Seattle
and
Berkeley
).
[
24
]
[
29
]
This experience influenced the composition of
Music for Mallet Instruments, Voices and Organ
(1973).
[
28
]
Another work from this period is
Six Pianos
(1973).

In 1974, Reich began writing
Music for 18 Musicians
. This piece involved many new ideas, although it also recalls earlier pieces. It is based on a
cycle
of
eleven chords
introduced at the beginning (called "Pulses"), followed by a small section of music based on each
chord
("Sections I-XI"), and finally a return to the original cycle ("Pulses II"). This was Reich's first attempt at writing for larger
ensembles
. The increased number of performers resulted in more scope for psychoacoustic effects, which fascinated Reich, and he noted that he would like to "explore this idea further". Reich remarked that this one work contained more harmonic movement in the first five minutes than any other work he had written. Steve Reich and Musicians made the
premier recording
of this work on
ECM Records
.

One of Reich’s characteristic compositional strategies for his minimalist work is his omission of bass notes to avoid tonal structure. “The reason lay in his antipathy to the functionality, which Reich thought inevitable, of the bass in determining and spelling out a tonal center and the relationships developed around this”. "Music for 18 Musicians” maintains his minimalist feel through these “phases” and harmonic shifts. A piece with rich tonal exploration about an hour’s length performance can only provide so much melodic opportunity, so repetitive rhythmic structure also plays a large role in this.
[
30
]

Reich explored these ideas further in his frequently recorded pieces
Music for a Large Ensemble
(1978) and
Octet
(1979). In these two works, Reich experimented with "the human breath as the measure of musical duration ... the chords played by the trumpets are written to take one comfortable breath to perform".
[
31
]
Human voices are part of the musical palette in
Music for a Large Ensemble
but the wordless vocal parts simply form part of the texture (as they do in
Drumming
). With
Octet
and his first orchestral piece
Variations for Winds, Strings and Keyboards
(also 1979), Reich's music showed the influence of Biblical
cantillation
, which he had studied in Israel since the summer of 1977. After this, the human voice singing a text would play an increasingly important role in Reich's music.

In 1974 Reich published the book
Writings About Music
, containing essays on his philosophy, aesthetics, and musical projects written between 1963 and 1974. An updated and much more extensive collection,
Writings On Music (1965–2000)
, was published in 2002.

Reich's work took on a darker character in the 1980s with the introduction of historical themes as well as themes from his Jewish heritage.
Tehillim
(1981),
Hebrew
for
psalms
, is the first of Reich's works to draw explicitly on his Jewish background. The work is in four parts, and is scored for an ensemble of four women's voices (one high
soprano
, two lyric sopranos and one
alto
),
piccolo
, flute,
oboe
,
English horn
, two
clarinets
, six percussion (playing small tuned
tambourines
without jingles, clapping,
maracas
,
marimba
,
vibraphone
and
crotales
), two
electronic organs
, two violins,
viola
, cello and double bass, with amplified voices, strings, and winds. A setting of texts from Psalms 19:2–5 (19:1–4 in Christian translations), 34:13–15 (34:12–14), 18:26–27 (18:25–26), and 150:4–6,
Tehillim
is a departure from Reich's other work in its formal structure; the setting of texts several lines long rather than the fragments used in previous works makes melody a substantive element. Use of formal
counterpoint
and functional
harmony
also contrasts with the loosely structured minimalist works written previously. The musicologist Ronit Seter described it as "one of a very few non-Israeli works where the setting of the Hebrew text feels natural", reflecting Reich's extensive research into modern Hebrew-Israeli speech, ancient Psalmic prosody and Jewish cantillation traditions.
[
33
]

Different Trains
(1988), for
string quartet
and tape, uses recorded speech, as in his earlier works, but this time as a melodic rather than a rhythmic element. In
Different Trains
, Reich compares and contrasts his childhood memories of his train journeys between New York and California in 1939–1941 with the very different trains being used to transport contemporaneous European children to their deaths under
Nazi
rule. The
Kronos Quartet
recording of
Different Trains
was awarded the
Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition
in 1990. The composition was described by
Richard Taruskin
as "the only adequate musical response—one of the few adequate artistic responses in any medium—to
the Holocaust
", and he credited the piece with earning Reich a place among the great composers of the 20th century.
[
34
]

In 1993, Reich collaborated with his wife, the video artist
Beryl Korot
, on an opera,
The Cave
, which explores the roots of Judaism, Christianity and Islam through the words of Israelis,
Palestinians
, and Americans, echoed musically by the ensemble. The work, for percussion, voices, and strings, is a musical documentary, named for the
Cave of Machpelah
in
Hebron
, where a mosque now stands and
Abraham
is said to have been buried. According to musicologist Ronit Seter, the work "share[s] the confrontational, yet peaceful message" conveyed by contemporaneous Israeli composers.
[
33
]

Reich and Korot collaborated on the opera
Three Tales
, which concerns the
Hindenburg
disaster
, the testing of
nuclear weapons
on
Bikini Atoll
, and other more modern concerns, specifically
Dolly the sheep
,
cloning
, and the
technological singularity
.

Reich used sampling techniques for pieces like
Three Tales
and
City Life
from 1994. Reich returned to composing purely instrumental works for the concert hall, starting with
Triple Quartet
in 1998 written for the Kronos Quartet that can either be performed by string quartet and tape, three string quartets or 36-piece string orchestra. According to Reich, the piece is influenced by
Bartók
's and
Alfred Schnittke
's string quartets, and
Michael Gordon
's
Yo Shakespeare
.
[
35
]

The instrumental series for the concert hall continued with
Dance Patterns
(2002),
Cello Counterpoint
(2003), and multiple works centered around variations:
You Are (Variations)
(2004),
Variations for Vibes, Pianos, and Strings
(2005), and the
Daniel Variations
(2006).
You Are
looks back to the vocal writing of
Tehillim
and
The Desert Music
while the
Daniel Variations
, which Reich called "much darker, not at all what I'm known for", are partly inspired by the death of
Daniel Pearl
.
[
36
]

In 2002 Reich was invited by
Walter Fink
to the annual
Komponistenporträt
of the
Rheingau Musik Festival
, as the 12th composer featured.

In December 2010
Nonesuch Records
and
Indaba Music
held a community remix contest in which over 250 submissions were received, and Steve Reich and Christian Carey judged the finals. Reich spoke in a related BBC interview that once he composed a piece he would not alter it again himself; "When it's done, it's done," he said. On the other hand, he acknowledged that remixes have an old tradition e.g. famous religious music pieces where melodies were further developed into new songs.
[
37
]

Reich premiered a piece,
WTC 9/11
, written for String Quartet and Tape (a similar instrumentation to that of
Different Trains
) in March 2011. This was a response to the
September 11 attacks
and used recordings from emergency services and from family members who were in New York during the attacks.
[
38
]
It was premiered by the
Kronos Quartet
, at
Duke University
, North Carolina, US.
[
39
]

On March 5, 2013, the London Sinfonietta, conducted by Brad Lubman, at the
Royal Festival Hall
in London gave the world premiere of
Radio Rewrite
, Reich's work inspired by the band
Radiohead
. The programme also included
Double Sextet
,
Clapping Music
, featuring Reich himself alongside percussionist
Colin Currie
,
Electric Counterpoint
, with electric guitar by
Mats Bergström
as well as two of Reich's ensemble pieces.
[
40
]

Music for Ensemble and Orchestra
was premiered on November 4, 2018 by the
Los Angeles Philharmonic
under
Susanna Mälkki
at
Walt Disney Concert Hall
, marking Reich's return to writing for orchestra after an interval of more than thirty years.
[
41
]
[
42
]

Reich has lived with his wife Beryl Korot in a home in
upstate New York
since 2006.
[
43
]

In 2005, Reich was awarded the Edward MacDowell Medal.
[
44
]
[
45
]

Reich was awarded with the
Praemium Imperiale
Award in Music in October 2006.
[
46
]

On January 25, 2007, Reich was named 2007 recipient of the
Polar Music Prize
with jazz saxophonist
Sonny Rollins
.
[
47
]

On April 20, 2009, Reich was awarded the 2009
Pulitzer Prize for Music
, recognizing
Double Sextet
, first performed in Richmond March 26, 2008. The citation called it "a major work that displays an ability to channel an initial burst of energy into a large-scale musical event, built with masterful control and consistently intriguing to the ear".
[
48
]
[
49
]

In May 2011 Steve Reich received an honorary doctorate from the
New England Conservatory of Music
.
[
50
]

In 2012, Steve Reich received the Gold Medal in Music by the American Academy of Arts and Letters.
[
51
]

In 2013 Reich received the US$400,000
BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award
in contemporary music for bringing a new conception of music, based on the use of realist elements from the realm of daily life and others drawn from the traditional music of Africa and Asia.
[
52
]

In September 2014, Reich was awarded the "Leone d'Oro" (Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement in Music) from the
Venice Biennale
.
[
53
]

In March 2016, Reich was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the
Royal College of Music
in London.
[
54
]

The American composer and critic
Kyle Gann
has said that Reich "may ... be considered, by general acclamation, America's greatest living composer".
[
55
]
Writing in
The Guardian
, music critic Andrew Clements has suggested that Reich is one of "a handful of living composers who can legitimately claim to have altered the direction of musical history".
[

Reich's style of composition has influenced many other composers and musical groups, including
John Adams
,
Michael Nyman
,
Aphex Twin
,
Björk
,
Sonic Youth
,
American Football

John Adams commented, "He didn't reinvent the wheel so much as he showed us a new way to ride."
[
68
]
He has also influenced visual artists such as
Bruce Nauman
, and many notable choreographers have made dances to his music,
Eliot Feld
,
Jiří Kylián
,
Douglas Lee
and
Jerome Robbins
among others; he has expressed particular admiration of
Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker
's work set to his pieces.

In featuring a sample of Reich's
Electric Counterpoint
(1987) in the 1990 track
Little Fluffy Clouds
the British
ambient techno
act
the Orb
exposed a new generation of listeners to his music.
[
69
]
In 1999 the album
Reich Remixed
featured
remixes
of a number of Reich's works by various electronic dance-music producers, such as
DJ Spooky
,
Kurtis Mantronik
,
Ken Ishii
, and
Coldcut
among others.
[
69
]
[
70
]

Reich's
Cello Counterpoint
(2003) was the inspiration for a series of commissions for solo cello with pre-recorded cellos made by
Ashley Bathgate
in 2017 including new works by
Emily Cooley
and
Alex Weiser
.
[
71
]

Reich often cites
Pérotin
,
J. S. Bach
,
Debussy
,
Bartók
, and
Stravinsky
as composers whom he admires and who greatly influenced him when he was young.
[
72
]
Jazz is a major part of the formation of Reich's musical style, and two of the earliest influences on his work were vocalists
Ella Fitzgerald
and
Alfred Deller
, whose emphasis on the artistic capabilities of the voice alone with little vibrato or other alteration was an inspiration to his earliest works.
John Coltrane
's style, which Reich has described as "playing a lot of notes to very few harmonies", also had an impact; of particular interest was the album
Africa/Brass
, which "was basically a half-an-hour in E".
[
73
]
Reich's influence from jazz includes its roots, also, from the West African music he studied in his readings and visit to Ghana. Other important influences are
Kenny Clarke
and
Miles Davis
, and visual artist friends such as
Sol LeWitt
and
Richard Serra
. Reich has also stated that he admires the music of the band
Radiohead
, which led to his composition
Radio Rewrite
.
