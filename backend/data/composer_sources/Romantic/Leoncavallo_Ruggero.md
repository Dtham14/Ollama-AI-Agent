## Biography

Ruggero
(or
Ruggiero
)
[
a
]
Leoncavallo
[
b
]
(23 April 1857 – 9 August 1919) was an Italian
opera
composer
and
librettist
. Throughout his career, Leoncavallo produced numerous operas and songs, but it is his 1892 opera
Pagliacci
that remained his lasting contribution, despite attempts to escape the shadow of his greatest success.

Today
Pagliacci
continues to be his most famous opera and one of the most popular and frequently performed works in the operatic repertory. His other notable compositions include the song "
Mattinata
", popularized by
Enrico Caruso
, and, to a lesser extent, his version of
La bohème
which, however, was overshadowed by
Puccini
's highly successful
opera of the same name
.

The son of Vincenzo Leoncavallo, a police
magistrate
and judge, Leoncavallo was born in
Naples
, at the time the capital of the
Kingdom of the Two Sicilies
, on 23 April 1857.
[

As a child, Leoncavallo moved with his father to the town of
Montalto Uffugo
in
Calabria
, where he lived during his adolescence. In 1868 he returned to Naples, where he eventually became a student at
San Pietro a Majella Conservatory
.
[

From 1876 to 1877, he studied literature under the famed Italian poet
Giosuè Carducci
[
9
]
at the
University of Bologna
.
[
10
]
He also lived in
Potenza
, since 1876 until 1878.
[

In 1879, Leoncavallo's uncle Giuseppe, director of the press department at the Foreign Ministry in Egypt, suggested that his young nephew come to Cairo to showcase his pianistic abilities. Ruggero Leoncavallo arrived in Egypt shortly after the Ottoman Sultan
Abdul Hamid II
had deposed
Khedive Ismail
(June 1879) and replaced him as
Khedive of Egypt
with Ismail's son
Tewfik Pasha
.
Mahmud Hamdi Pasha
(1863–1921), the teenage brother of the new Khedive, appointed Ruggero Leoncavallo as "his private musician".
[

His time in Egypt concluded abruptly in mid-1882, as the British
intervened
in the
Urabi revolt
of 1879–1882 in
Alexandria
and Cairo led by
Ahmed Urabi
; the composer fled and travelled to France.
[
13
]
In Paris, Leoncavallo found lodging in
Montmartre
.

An agent located in the
Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Denis
secured Leoncavallo employment as an accompanist and instructor for artists who performed in Sunday concerts mostly at cafés. In Paris, Leoncavallo met the singer Berthe Rambaud (1869–1926) who became his "preferred student"; they became partners in Paris in 1888 and married in Milan in 1895.
[

Increasingly inspired by the French romantics, particularly
Alfred de Musset
, Leoncavallo began work on a symphonic poem based on Musset's poetry entitled
La nuit de mai
. The work was completed in Paris in 1886 and premiered in April 1887 to critical acclaim. With this success, and now with enough accumulated money, in 1888 Leoncavallo moved to Milan with Rambaud.

Back in Italy, Leoncavallo spent some years teaching and attempting ineffectively to obtain the production of more than one opera, notably
Chatterton
. In 1890 he saw the enormous success of
Pietro Mascagni
's
Cavalleria rusticana
and wasted no time in producing his own
verismo
work,
Pagliacci
. (According to Leoncavallo, the plot of this work had a real-life origin: he claimed it derived from a murder trial in Montalto Uffugo, over which his father had presided.)

Pagliacci
was performed in Milan in 1892 with immediate success; today it is the only work by Leoncavallo in the standard operatic repertory.
[
19
]
Its most famous aria, "
Vesti la giubba
" ("Put on the costume" or, in the better-known older translation, "On with the motley"), was recorded by
Enrico Caruso
and laid claim to being the world's first record to sell a million copies (although this is probably a total of Caruso's various versions of it, made in 1902, 1904 and 1907).

The next year his
I Medici
was also produced in Milan, but neither it nor
Chatterton
(belatedly produced in 1896)—both early works—obtained much lasting favour. Much of
Chatterton
, however, was recorded by the Gramophone Company (later
His Master's Voice
) as early as 1908, and remastered on CD almost 100 years later by
Marston Records
. Leoncavallo himself conducts the performance or at very least supervises the production.
[

It was not until Leoncavallo's
La bohème
was performed in 1897 in Venice that his talent obtained public confirmation. However, this work was outshone by
Puccini
's
opera of the same name
and on the same subject, which had been premiered by the
Teatro Regio
in Turin in February 1896.
[
21
]
Two tenor arias from Leoncavallo's version are still occasionally performed, especially in Italy.

Subsequent operas by Leoncavallo in the 1900s were:
Zazà
(the opera of
Geraldine Farrar
's famous 1922 farewell performance at the
Metropolitan Opera
), and 1904's
Der Roland von Berlin
. In 1906 the composer brought singers and orchestral musicians from La Scala to perform concerts of his music in New York, as well as making an extensive tour of the United States. The tour was, all in all, a qualified success.
[
22
]
He had a brief success with
Zingari
, which premiered in Italian in London in 1912, with a long run at the
Hippodrome Theatre
.
Zingari
also reached the United States but soon disappeared from the repertoire.
[
23
]

After a series of
operettas
, Leoncavallo appeared to have tried for one last serious effort with
Edipo re
. It had always been assumed that Leoncavallo had finished the work but had died before he could finish the
orchestration
, which was completed by
Giovanni Pennacchio
[
it
]
. However, with the publication of
Konrad Dryden
's biography of Leoncavallo
[
24
]
it was revealed that Leoncavallo may not have written the work at all (although it certainly contains themes by Leoncavallo). A review of Dryden's study notes: "That fine
Edipo re
... was not even composed by [Leoncavallo]. His widow paid another composer to concoct a new opera using the music of
Der Roland von Berlin
. Dryden didn't find one reference to the opera in Leoncavallo's correspondence nor is there a single note by him to be found in the handwritten score."
[
25
]
Pennacchio may either have concocted the opera or have had to do more to Leoncavallo's incomplete work
[
26
]
[
27
]
to "fill in the gaps" using Leoncavallo's earlier music.

Leoncavallo died in
Montecatini Terme
, Tuscany, on 9 August 1919. His funeral was held two days later, with hundreds in attendance, including fellow composer
Pietro Mascagni
and longtime rival
Giacomo Puccini
. He was buried in the
Cimitero delle Porte Sante
in Florence.

70 years after his death a campaign was launched to move the composer's remains to
Brissago
, Switzerland, after an alleged letter written by Leoncavallo claimed to show he had desired to be buried there originally, although no such letter was ever found. Leoncavallo became an honorary citizen of Brissago and owned a lavish summer residence, Villa Myriam, in the town; in 1904 the composer had mentioned in a speech that he would not mind having a resting place in the town's Madonna di Porte cemetery, but it was never a written request in his will. Regardless the campaign to move Leoncavallo's remains moved ahead and was granted official approval by Piera Leoncavallo-Grand, the last remaining descendant of the composer; Ruggero Leoncavallo's body was exhumed on 22 September 1989 for transfer to Switzerland.

and burial there, alongside the remains of his wife Berthe (who had died in 1926).
[

]

The Museo Leoncavallo (Leoncavallo Museum) was established in 2002 in Brissago to commemorate the composer. It includes personal items and original manuscripts on display as well as statues representing characters from his operas
Zazà
and
Der Roland von Berlin
. The Museo Ruggiero Leoncavallo in the composer's childhood home of Montalto Uffugo was opened in 2010 and also contains various manuscripts and personal items, as well as Leoncavallo's personal piano.
[
31
]

Little from Leoncavallo's other operas is heard today, but the baritone arias from
Zazà
were great concert and recording favourites among baritones and
Zazà
as a whole is sometimes revived, as is his
La bohème
. The tenor arias from
La bohème
remain recording favorites.

Leoncavallo also composed songs, most famously
"Mattinata"
, which he wrote for the Gramophone Company (which became
His Master's Voice
) with Caruso's unique voice in mind. On 8 April 1904, Leoncavallo accompanied Caruso at the piano as they recorded the song. On 8 December 1905 he recorded five of his own pieces for the
reproducing piano
Welte-Mignon
.

Leoncavallo wrote the libretti for most of his own operas;
[
34
]
[
35
]
after the death in 1918 of
Arrigo Boito
some ranked Leoncavallo as the greatest librettist in Italy.
[
36
]
His work for other composers included a contribution to the libretto for Puccini's 1893 work
Manon Lescaut
.
