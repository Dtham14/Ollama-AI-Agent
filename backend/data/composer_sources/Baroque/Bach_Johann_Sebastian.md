## Biography

Johann Sebastian Bach
[
n 1
]
(31 March [
O.S.
21 March] 1685 – 28 July 1750) was a German composer and musician of the late
Baroque period
. He is known for his prolific output across a variety of instruments and forms, including the orchestral
Brandenburg Concertos
; solo instrumental works such as the
cello suites
and
sonatas and partitas for solo violin
; keyboard works such as the
Goldberg Variations
and
The Well-Tempered Clavier
; organ works such as the
Schübler Chorales
and the
Toccata and Fugue in D minor
; and choral works such as the
St Matthew Passion
and the
Mass in B minor
. Since the 19th-century
Bach Revival
, he has been widely regarded as one of the greatest composers in the history of Western music.

The
Bach family
had already produced several composers when Johann Sebastian was born as the last child of a city musician,
Johann Ambrosius
, in
Eisenach
. After being orphaned at age 10, he lived for five years with his eldest brother,
Johann Christoph
, then continued his musical education in
Lüneburg
. In 1703 he returned to
Thuringia
, working as a musician for
Protestant
churches in
Arnstadt
and
Mühlhausen
. Around that time he also visited for longer periods the courts in
Weimar
, where he expanded his
organ
repertory, and the
reformed
court at
Köthen
, where he was mostly engaged with
chamber music
. By 1723 he was hired as
Thomaskantor
(
cantor
with related duties at
St Thomas School
) in
Leipzig
. There he composed music for the principal
Lutheran
churches of the city and
Leipzig University
's student ensemble,
Collegium Musicum
. In 1726 he began
publishing
his organ and other keyboard music. In Leipzig, as had happened during some of his earlier positions, he had difficult relations with his employer. This situation was somewhat remedied when his sovereign,
Augustus III of Poland
, granted him the title of court composer of the Elector of Saxony in 1736. In the last decades of his life, Bach reworked and extended many of his earlier compositions. He died due to complications following eye surgery in 1750 at the age of 65. Four of his twenty children,
Wilhelm Friedemann
,
Carl Philipp Emanuel
,
Johann Christoph Friedrich
, and
Johann Christian
, became composers.

Bach enriched established German styles through his mastery of
counterpoint
,
harmonic
and
motivic
organisation, and his adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly Italy and France.
His compositions
include
hundreds of cantatas
, both
sacred
and
secular
. He composed
Latin church music
,
Passions
,
oratorios
, and
motets
. He adopted
Lutheran hymns
, not only in his larger vocal works but also in such works as
his four-part chorales
and
his sacred songs
. Bach wrote extensively
for organ
and
other keyboard instruments
. He
composed concertos
, for instance
for violin
and
for harpsichord
, and
suites
,
as chamber music
as well as
for orchestra
.
Many of his works use contrapuntal techniques
like
canon
and
fugue
.

Several decades after the end of his life, in the 18th century, Bach was still primarily known as an
organist
. Several
biographies of Bach
were published in the 19th century, and by the end of that century all of his known music had been printed.
[

]
Dissemination of Bach scholarship continued through periodicals (and later also websites) devoted to him, other publications such as the
Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis
(BWV, a numbered catalogue of his works), and new critical editions of his compositions. His music was further popularised by a
multitude of arrangements
, including the "
Air on the G String
" and "
Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring
", and recordings, among them three different box sets of performances of his complete
oeuvre
marking the 250th anniversary of his death. By 2013, more than 150 recordings had been made of his
Well-Tempered Clavier
.

Johann Sebastian Bach was born in
Eisenach
, the capital of the
duchy of Saxe-Eisenach
, in present-day Germany, on 21 March 1685
O.S.
[
7
]
[
8
]
[
n 2
]
He was the eighth and youngest child of
Johann Ambrosius Bach
, the director of the town musicians, and
Maria Elisabeth
née
Lämmerhirt
, daughter of a town councillor.
[
10
]
[
11
]
[
12
]
The
Bach family
, traditionally traced to the patriarch
Vitus "Veit" Bach
(
d.
1619
), produced three to four generations of musicians in the
Thuringia
region, whose insular cultural climate fostered conservative musicianship, with external influences arriving mainly via the courts.
[
13
]
Nothing is definitively known about Bach's early years before 1693; his
musical education
in particular is highly conjectural.
[
10
]
His family, particularly the uncles, were all professional musicians who worked as church organists, court chamber musicians, and composers.
[
14
]
Bach's father presumably taught him the
violin
, Ambrosius' own primary instrument, along with basic
music theory
principles.
[
15
]
[
16
]
One uncle,
Johann Christoph Bach
(1645–1693), may have introduced him to the
organ
, though this is debated since the uncle may not have been close to the immediate family.
[
15
]
[
16
]

Bach's mother died in 1694, and his father eight months later in February 1695.
[
17
]
The 10-year-old Bach moved in with his eldest brother,
Johann Christoph Bach
(1671–1721), the organist at
St Michael's Church
in
Ohrdruf
,
Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg
.
[
18
]
There he studied, performed, and copied music, including his brother's, despite being forbidden to do so because scores were so valuable and private and ledger paper was costly.
[
19
]
[
20
]
From his brother he also received instruction on the
clavichord
. Johann Christoph exposed him to the works of composers of the day, including South Germans such as
Johann Caspar Kerll
,
Johann Jakob Froberger
, and
Johann Pachelbel
(under whom Johann Christoph had studied); North Germans such as
Georg Böhm
,
Johann Reincken
and
Friedrich Nicolaus Bruhns
from Hamburg, and
Dieterich Buxtehude
;
[
21
]
Frenchmen such as
Jean-Baptiste Lully
,
Louis Marchand
, and
Marin Marais
;
[
22
]
and the Italian
Girolamo Frescobaldi
.
[
23
]
He learned
theology
,
Latin
, and
Greek
at the local
gymnasium
.
[
24
]

By 3 April 1700 Bach and his school friend Georg Erdmann—who was two years older—began studies at
St Michael
's School in
Lüneburg
, two weeks' travel north of Ohrdruf.
[
25
]
[
26
]
Their journey was probably undertaken mostly on foot.
[
26
]
He sang in the choir and had opportunities to pursue his interest in instrumental music:
[
27
]
recently, evidence has come to light that he received organ lessons.
[
28
]
He also came into contact with sons of aristocrats from northern Germany who had been sent to the nearby
Ritter-Academie
to prepare for careers in other disciplines.
[
29
]

Four months after arriving at Mühlhausen in 1707, Bach married
Maria Barbara Bach
, his second cousin.
[
27
]
Later that year their first child, Catharina Dorothea, was born, and Maria Barbara's elder, unmarried sister joined them. She remained to help run the household until she died in 1729. Three sons were also born:
Wilhelm Friedemann
,
Carl Philipp Emanuel
, and
Johann Gottfried Bernhard
. All became musicians, and the first two composers. Johann Sebastian and Maria Barbara had seven children. Their twins born in 1713 died within a year, and their last son, Leopold, also died within a year of his birth.
[
30
]
On 7 July 1720, while Bach was away in
Carlsbad
with Prince Leopold, Maria Barbara died suddenly.
[
31
]
The next year, he met
Anna Magdalena Wilcke
, a gifted
soprano
16 years his junior, while she was performing at the court in Köthen; they married on 3 December 1721.
[
32
]
Together they had 13 children, six of whom survived into adulthood:
Gottfried Heinrich
; Elisabeth Juliane Friederica (1726–1781);
Johann Christoph Friedrich
and
Johann Christian
, who both became musicians; Johanna Carolina (1737–1781); and Regina Susanna (1742–1809).
[
33
]

In January 1703, shortly after graduating from St. Michael's in 1702 and being turned down for the post of organist at
Sangerhausen
,
[
34
]
Bach was appointed court musician in the chapel of Duke
Johann Ernst III
in
Weimar
.
[
35
]
His role there is unclear, but it probably included menial, non-musical duties. During his seven-month tenure at Weimar, his reputation as a keyboardist spread so widely that he was invited to inspect the new organ and give the inaugural recital at the New Church (now
Bach Church
) in
Arnstadt
, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) southwest of Weimar.
[
36
]
On 14 August 1703 he became the organist at the New Church,
[
16
]
with light duties, a relatively generous salary, and a new organ tuned in a temperament that allowed music written in a wider range of keys to be played.
[
37
]

Despite a musically enthusiastic employer, tension built up between Bach and his employer after several years in the post. For example, Bach upset his employer with a prolonged absence from Arnstadt: after obtaining leave for four weeks, he was absent for around four months in 1705–1706 to take lessons from the organist and composer
Johann Adam Reincken
and to hear him and
Dieterich Buxtehude
play in the northern city of
Lübeck
.
[
38
]
The visit to Buxtehude and Reincken involved a 450-kilometre (280 mi) journey each way, reportedly on foot.
[
39
]
[
40
]
Buxtehude probably introduced Bach to his friend Reincken so that he could learn from his compositional technique (especially his mastery of
fugue
), his organ playing and his skills with improvisation. Bach knew Reincken's music very well; he copied Reincken's monumental
An Wasserflüssen Babylon
when he was 15 years old. Bach later wrote several other works on the same theme. When Bach revisited Reincken in 1720 and showed him his improvisatory skills on the organ, Reincken reportedly remarked: "I thought that this art was dead, but I see that it lives in you."
[
41
]

In 1706 Bach applied for a post as organist at the
Blasius Church
in
Mühlhausen
.
[
42
]
[
43
]
As part of his application, he had a
cantata
performed at
Easter
, 24 April 1707, that resembles his later
Christ lag in Todes Banden
BMV 4.
[
44
]
Bach's application was accepted a month later, and he took up the post in July.
[
42
]
The position included higher remuneration, improved conditions, and a better choir. Bach persuaded the church and town government at Mühlhausen to fund an expensive renovation of the organ at the Blasius Church. In 1708 Bach wrote
Gott ist mein König
, a festive
cantata for the inauguration of the new council
, which was published at the council's expense.
[
27
]
[
45
]
This was the only extant Bach cantata published in his lifetime.
[
46
]

Bach left Mühlhausen in 1708, returning to Weimar this time as organist and from 1714
Konzertmeister
(director of music) at the ducal court, where he could work with a large, well-funded contingent of professional musicians.
[
27
]
Bach and his wife moved into a house near the ducal palace.
[
47
]
Bach's time in Weimar began a sustained period of composing keyboard and orchestral works. He attained the proficiency and confidence to extend the prevailing structures and include influences from abroad. He learned to write dramatic openings and employ the dynamic rhythms and harmonic schemes used by Italians such as
Vivaldi
,
Corelli
, and
Torelli
. Bach absorbed these stylistic aspects to a certain extent by transcribing Vivaldi's string and wind concertos for harpsichord and organ. He was particularly attracted to the Italian style, in which one or more solo instruments alternate section-by-section with the full orchestra throughout a
movement
.
[
48
]

In Weimar Bach continued to play and compose for the organ and perform concert music with the duke's ensemble.
[
27
]
He also began to write the
preludes
and
fugues
that were later assembled into the first volume of
The Well-Tempered Clavier
("clavier" meaning clavichord or harpsichord),
[
49
]
which eventually comprised two volumes written over 20 years,
[
50
]
each containing 24 pairings of preludes and fugues in every
major
and
minor
key. In Weimar, Bach also started work on the
Little Organ Book
, containing traditional
Lutheran chorale
tunes set in complex textures. In 1713 Bach was offered a post in
Halle
when he advised the authorities during a renovation by Christoph Cuntzius of the main organ in the west gallery of the
Market Church of Our Dear Lady
.
[
51
]
[
52
]

In early 1714 Bach was promoted to
Konzertmeister
, an honour that entailed performing a church cantata monthly in the castle church.
[
53
]
The first three cantatas in the new series Bach composed in Weimar were
Himmelskönig, sei willkommen
, BWV 182
, for
Palm Sunday
, which coincided with the
Annunciation
that year;
Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen
, BWV 12
, for
Jubilate Sunday
; and
Erschallet, ihr Lieder, erklinget, ihr Saiten!
BWV 172
, for
Pentecost
.
[
54
]
Bach's first Christmas cantata,
Christen, ätzet diesen Tag
, BWV 63
, premiered in 1714 or 1715.
[
55
]
[
56
]
In 1717 Bach fell out of favour in Weimar and, according to the court secretary's report, was jailed for almost a month before being unfavourably dismissed: "On November 6, [1717,] the quondam [former] concertmaster and organist Bach was confined to the County Judge's place of detention for too stubbornly forcing the issue of his dismissal and finally on December 2 was freed from arrest with notice of his unfavourable discharge."
[
57
]

Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen
, hired Bach to serve as his
Kapellmeister
(director of music) in 1717. Himself a musician, Leopold appreciated Bach's talents, paid him well, and gave him considerable latitude in composing and performing. Leopold was a
Calvinist
and thus did not use elaborate music in his form of worship, so most of Bach's work from this period is secular,
[
58
]
including the
orchestral suites
,
cello suites
,
sonatas and partitas for solo violin
, and the
Brandenburg Concertos
.
[
59
]
Bach also composed secular cantatas for the court, such as
Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht
, BWV 134a
.
[
60
]

Despite being born the same year and about 130 kilometers (80 mi) away, Bach never met his celebrated contemporary
George Frideric Handel
. In 1719, Bach made the 35-kilometre (22 mi) journey from
Köthen
to
Halle
with the intention to meet Handel, but Handel had left town.
[
61
]
[
62
]
In 1730, Bach's oldest son, Wilhelm Friedemann, travelled to Halle to invite Handel to visit the Bach family in Leipzig, but the visit did not take place.
[
63
]

Leipzig was "the leading cantorate in Protestant Germany",
[
64
]
located in the mercantile city in the
Electorate of Saxony
. In 1723, Bach was appointed
Thomaskantor
(director of church music) in Leipzig. He was responsible for directing the
St Thomas School
and for providing four churches with music, the
St Thomas Church
, the
St Nicholas Church
, and to a lesser extent, the
New Church
and
St Peter's Church
.
[
65
]
Bach held the position for 27 years, until his death. During that time, he gained further prestige through honorary appointments at the courts of Köthen and
Weissenfels
, as well as that of the Elector
Frederick Augustus
(who was also
King of Poland
) in
Dresden
.
[
64
]
Bach frequently disagreed with his employer, Leipzig's city council, whom he regarded as "penny-pinching".
[
66
]

Johann Kuhnau
had been Thomaskantor in Leipzig from 1701 until his death on 5 June 1722. Bach had visited Leipzig during Kuhnau's tenure: in 1714 he attended the service at the St. Thomas Church on the first Sunday of Advent,
[
67
]
and in 1717 he had tested the organ of the
St. Paul's Church
.
[
68
]
In 1716 Bach and Kuhnau met on the occasion of the testing and inauguration of an organ in Halle.
[
52
]
The position was offered to Bach only after it had been offered to
Georg Philipp Telemann
and then
Christoph Graupner
—both of whom chose to stay where they were, Telemann in
Hamburg
and Graupner in
Darmstadt
—after using the Leipzig offer to negotiate better terms of employment.
[
69
]
[
70
]
Bach was required to instruct the
Thomasschule
students in singing and provide music for Leipzig's main churches. He was also assigned to teach Latin, but was allowed to employ four "prefects" (deputies) to do this instead. The prefects also aided with musical instruction.
[
71
]
A cantata was required for the church services on each Sunday and additional church holidays during the
liturgical year
.
[
72
]

Bach usually led performances of his
cantatas
, most composed within three years of his relocation to Leipzig. He assumed the office of Thomaskantor on 30 May 1723, presenting the first new cantata,
Die Elenden sollen essen
, BWV 75
, in the St. Nicholas Church on the first Sunday after
Trinity
.
[
73
]
Bach collected his cantatas in annual cycles, with the first starting in 1723. Five are mentioned in obituaries, and three are extant.
[
54
]
Of the more than 300 cantatas he composed in Leipzig, over 100 have been lost.
[
74
]
Most of these works expound on the Gospel readings prescribed for every Sunday and feast day in the Lutheran year. Bach started a second annual cycle on the first Sunday after the Trinity of 1724 and composed only
chorale cantatas
, each based on a single church hymn. These include
O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort
, BWV 20
,
Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme
, BWV 140
,
Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland
, BWV 62
, and
Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern
, BWV 1
.
[
75
]

Bach drew the soprano and alto choristers from the school and the tenors and basses from the school and elsewhere in Leipzig. Performing at weddings and funerals provided extra income for these groups; probably for this purpose, and for in-school training, he wrote at least six
motets
, such as
BWV 227
.
[
76
]
As part of his regular church work, he performed other composers' motets, which served as formal models for his own.
[
77
]
Bach's predecessor as cantor, Johann Kuhnau, had also been music director for the Paulinerkirch (St Paul's Church), the church of
Leipzig University
. But when Bach was installed as cantor in 1723, he was put in charge only of music for church holiday services at the Paulinerkirch; his request to also provide music for regular Sunday services there for an added fee was denied.

In 1725 Bach "lost interest" in working even for festal services at the Paulinerkirch and decided to appear there only on "special occasions".
[
78
]
The Paulinerkirch had a much better and newer (1716) organ than the St Thomas Church or the St Nicholas Church.
[
79
]
Bach was not required to play any organ in his official duties, but it is believed he liked to play on the Paulinerkirch organ for his own pleasure.
[
80
]
Bach's last newly composed chorale cantata in his second year (his second annual cycle for cantata composition) in Leipzig was
Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern
, BWV 1
, for the feast of the
Annunciation
on 25
March, which fell on Palm Sunday in 1725. Of the chorale cantatas composed before Palm Sunday 1725, only K
77, 84, 89, 95, 96, and 109 (BWV
135, 113, 130, 80, 115, and 111) were not included in the
chorale cantata cycle
that was still extant in Leipzig in 1830.
[
81
]

Bach broadened his composing and performing beyond the liturgy by taking over, in March 1729, the directorship of the
Collegium Musicum
, a secular performance ensemble Telemann had started. This was one of the dozens of private societies in the major German-speaking cities established by musically active university students; they had become increasingly important in public musical life and were typically led by the most prominent professionals in a city. In the words of
Christoph Wolff
, assuming the directorship was a shrewd move that "consolidated Bach's firm grip on Leipzig's principal musical institutions".
[
82
]
Every week, the
Collegium Musicum
gave two-hour performances, in winter at the
Café Zimmermann
, a coffeehouse on Catherine Street off the main market square, and in summer in the owner Gottfried Zimmerman's outdoor coffee garden just outside the town walls, near the East Gate. The concerts, all free of charge, ended with Zimmermann's death in 1741. Apart from showcasing his earlier orchestral repertoire, such as the
Brandenburg Concertos
and orchestral suites, many of Bach's newly composed or reworked pieces were performed for these venues, including parts of his
Clavier-Übung
(
Keyboard Practice
), his violin and
keyboard concertos
, and the
Coffee Cantata
.
[
27
]
[
83
]

Before starting on the Gospel of Mark after 1730, Bach had composed the
St John Passion
and the
St Matthew Passion
; the latter was first performed on Good Friday 11 April 1727.
[
84
]
The 1731
St Mark Passion
(German:
Markus-Passion
),
BWV
247, is a lost
Passion setting
by Bach, first performed in Leipzig on
Good Friday
, 23 March 1731. Though Bach's music is lost, the libretto by
Picander
is extant, and the work can to some degree be reconstructed from it.
[
85
]
In 1733 Bach composed a
Kyrie–Gloria Mass in B minor
for the court in Dresden, which had become Catholic, that he later used in his Mass in B minor. He presented the manuscript to the Elector in a successful bid to persuade the prince to give him the title of Court Composer.
[
86
]
He later extended this work into a full mass by adding a
Credo
,
Sanctus
, and
Agnus Dei
, the music for which was partly based on his own cantatas and partly original. Bach's appointment as Court Composer was part of his long struggle to achieve greater bargaining power with the Leipzig council.

Bach composed his
Christmas Oratorio
for the 1734–35 Christmas season in
Leipzig
, by using works he had already composed such as the
Christmas cantatas
and other church music for all seven occasions of the Christmas season including part of
his Weimar cantata cycle
and
Christen, ätzet diesen Tag
, BWV 63
.
[
87
]
In 1735 Bach started preparing his first organ music publication, which was printed as the third
Clavier-Übung
in 1739.
[
88
]
From around that year he started to compile and compose the set of preludes and fugues for harpsichord that became the second book of
The Well-Tempered Clavier
.
[
89
]
He received the title of "Royal Court Composer" from
Augustus III
in 1736.
[
86
]
[
17
]
Between 1737 and 1739 Bach's former pupil
Carl Gotthelf Gerlach
held the directorship of the Collegium Musicum.
[
90
]

From 1740 to 1748 Bach copied, transcribed, expanded or programmed music in an older
polyphonic
style (
stile antico
) by, among others,
Palestrina
(
BNB I/P/2
),
[
91
]
Kerll
(
BWV 241
),
[
92
]
Torri
(
BWV Anh. 30
),
[
93
]
Bassani
(
BWV 1081
),
[
94
]
Gasparini
(
Missa Canonica
),
[
95
]
and
Caldara
(
BWV 1082
).
[
96
]
Bach's style shifted in the last decade of his life, showing an increased integration of elements of the
stile antico
, including polyphonic structures and canons.
[
97
]
His fourth and last
Clavier-Übung
volume, the
Goldberg Variations
for two-manual harpsichord, contains nine canons and was published in 1741.
[
98
]
During this period, Bach also continued to adapt music of contemporaries such as
Handel
(
BNB I/K/2
)
[
99
]
and
Stölzel
(
BWV 200
),
[
100
]
and gave many of his own earlier compositions, such as the
St Matthew
and
St John Passions
and the
Great Eighteen Chorale Preludes
,
[
101
]
their final revisions. He also programmed and adapted music by composers of a younger generation, including
Pergolesi
(
BWV 1083
),
[
102
]
and his own students, such as
Goldberg
(
BNB I/G/2
).
[
103
]

In 1746 Bach was preparing to enter
Lorenz Christoph Mizler
's
Society of Musical Sciences
[
de
]
.
[
104
]
To be admitted, he had to submit a composition. He chose his
Canonic Variations on "Vom Himmel hoch da komm' ich her"
, and a portrait painted by
Elias Gottlob Haussmann
that featured Bach's
Canon triplex á 6 Voc
.
[
105
]
In May 1747, Bach visited the court of King
Frederick II of Prussia
in
Potsdam
. The king played a theme for Bach and challenged him to improvise a fugue based on it. Bach obliged, playing a three-part fugue on one of Frederick's early prototypes of a new instrument, the
fortepiano
.
[

Upon his return to Leipzig he composed a set of fugues and canons and a trio sonata based on the
Thema Regium
("King's Theme"). Within a few weeks this music was published as
The Musical Offering
and dedicated to Frederick. The
Schübler Chorales
, a set of six chorale preludes transcribed from cantata movements Bach had written two decades earlier, were published within a year.
[
107
]
[
108
]
Around the same time, the set of five canonic variations Bach had submitted when entering Mizler's society in 1747 were also printed.
[
109
]

Two large-scale compositions occupied a central place in Bach's last years. Beginning around 1742 he wrote and revised the various canons and fugues of
The Art of Fugue
, which he continued to prepare for publication until shortly before his death.
[
110
]
[
111
]
After extracting a cantata,
BWV 191
from his
1733 Kyrie-Gloria Mass for the Dresden court
in the mid-1740s, Bach expanded that
setting
into his
Mass in B minor
in the last years of his life. The complete mass was not performed during his lifetime. It is considered among the greatest choral works in history.
[
112
]
In January 1749, with Bach in declining health, his daughter Elisabeth Juliane Friederica married his pupil
Johann Christoph Altnickol
. On 2 June
Heinrich von Brühl
wrote to one of the Leipzig
burgomasters
to request that his music director,
Gottlob Harrer
, fill the Thomaskantor and
Director musices
posts "upon the eventual ... decease of Mr. Bach".
[
113
]
His eyesight failing, Bach underwent eye surgery in March 1750 and again in April by the British eye surgeon
John Taylor
, a man widely understood today as a charlatan and believed to have blinded hundreds of people, including Bach's celebrated contemporary George Frideric Handel.
[
114
]

Bach died on 28 July 1750 from complications due to unsuccessful eye surgery.
[
115
]
He had a
stroke
a few days before his death.
[
116
]
[
117
]
[
118
]
He was originally buried at
Old St John's Cemetery
in Leipzig, where his grave went unmarked for nearly 150 years. In 1894, his remains were found and moved to a vault in
St John's Church
. This building was destroyed by
Allied bombing during the Second World War
, and in 1950 Bach's remains were taken to their present grave in St Thomas Church.
[
27
]
Later research has called into question whether the remains in the grave are actually Bach's.
[
119
]

An inventory drawn up a few months after Bach's death shows that his estate included five
harpsichords
, two
lute-harpsichords
, three
violins
, three
violas
, two
cellos
, a
viola da gamba
, a
lute
, a
spinet
, and 52 "sacred books", including works by
Martin Luther
and
Josephus
.
[
120
]
C. P. E. Bach saw to it that
The Art of Fugue
, though unfinished, was published in 1751.
[
121
]
Together with one of J. S. Bach's former students,
Johann Friedrich Agricola
, C. P. E. Bach also wrote the obituary ("
Nekrolog
"), which was published in Mizler's
Musikalische Bibliothek
[
de
]
, a periodical journal produced by the Society of Musical Sciences, in 1754.
[
109
]

In addition to his study of German composers and without visiting France or Italy, Bach absorbed influences from French and Italian music. From an early age, Bach studied the works of his musical contemporaries of the Baroque period and those of earlier generations, and those influences are reflected in his music.
[
122
]

The court at Weimar was particularly interested in Italian music. There have been questions of attribution about some of the music Bach was exposed to there, but
Antonio Vivaldi
was certainly an important influence on him. In particular, Bach borrowed the idea of propulsive rhythmic patterns.
[
123
]
[
124
]

Bach realised his other transcriptions of Vivaldi concertos after versions circulating as manuscript. Later versions of some of these were published in his
Op. 4
and
7
:

Bach also used the theme of the first movement of the "Spring" concerto from
The Four Seasons
for the third movement (
aria
) of his cantata
Wer weiß, wie nahe mir mein Ende? BWV 27
. Bach was deeply influenced by Vivaldi's concertos and arias (recalled in his
St John Passion
,
St Matthew Passion
, and
cantatas
). According to Christoph Wolff and Walter Emery, Bach transcribed six of Vivaldi's concerti for solo keyboard, three for organ, and one for four harpsichords, strings, and
basso continuo
(BWV 1065) based on Vivaldi's concerto for four violins, two violas, cello, and basso continuo (
RV
580).
[
16
]
[
131
]

Arcangelo Corelli
's influence in
chamber music
was not confined to his native Italy; his works were key in the development of the music of an entire generation of composers, including Bach, Vivaldi,
Georg Friedrich Handel
, and
François Couperin
. Bach studied Corelli's work and based an organ fugue (BWV 579) on his Opus 3 of 1689. Handel's
Opus 6
Concerti Grossi
take Corelli's older
Opus 6
Concerti
as models, rather than the later three-movement Venetian concerto of Vivaldi favoured by Bach.
[
132
]

Jean-Baptiste Lully
is credited with the invention in the 1650s of the
French overture
, a form used extensively in the Baroque and Classical eras, especially by Bach and Handel.
[
133
]
The later French composer
François Couperin
has been seen as an influence on the dance-based movements of Bach's keyboard suites.
[
134
]
The influence of Lully's music produced a radical revolution in the style and composition of the
dances
of the French court, which Bach made use of in his music. Instead of the slow and stately movements that had prevailed until Lully began composing, Lully introduced lively
ballets
of rapid
rhythm
, often based on well-known dance types such as
gavottes
,
menuets
,
rigaudons
, and
sarabandes
, forms often used by Bach.
[
135
]
[
136
]

Bach's creative range and musical style encompassed four-part harmony,
[
137
]
modulation,
[
138
]
ornamentation,
[
139
]
use of continuo instruments solos,
[
140
]
virtuoso instrumentation,
[
141
]
counterpoint,
[
142
]
and a refined attention to structure and lyrics.
[
143
]
[
144
]
Like his contemporaries Handel, Telemann, and Vivaldi, Bach composed concertos, suites, recitatives,
da capo arias
, and four-part choral music, and employed
basso continuo
. Most of the prints of Bach's music that appeared during his lifetime were commissioned by the composer.
[
145
]
His music is harmonically more innovative than his peers', employing surprisingly
dissonant
chords and progressions, often extensively exploring harmonic possibilities within one piece.
[
146
]

Bach's hundreds of sacred works are usually seen as manifesting not just his craft but also a deep faith in God.
[
147
]
[
148
]
His commitment to the Lutheran faith was reflected in his teaching
Luther's Small Catechism
as the
Thomaskantor
in Leipzig, and some of his pieces represent it.
[
149
]
The
Lutheran chorale
was the basis of much of his work. In elaborating these hymns into his chorale preludes, he wrote more cogent and tightly integrated works than most, even when they were massive and lengthy.
[
150
]
[
151
]
The large-scale structure of every major Bach sacred vocal work is evidence of subtle, elaborate planning to create religiously and musically powerful expression.
[
152
]
Bach published or carefully compiled in manuscript many collections of pieces that explored the range of artistic and technical possibilities inherent in almost every genre of his time except
opera
. For example,
The Well-Tempered Clavier
comprises two books, each of which presents a prelude and fugue in every major and minor key.
[
153
]

Four-part harmony
predates Bach, but he lived during a time when
modal music
in Western tradition was largely supplanted by the
tonal system
. In this system a piece of music progresses from one
chord
to the next according to certain rules, with each chord characterised by four notes. The principles of four-part harmony are found not only in Bach's four-part choral music; he also prescribes it for instance in
figured bass
accompaniment.
[
137
]
The new system was at the core of Bach's style. Some examples of this characteristic of Bach's style and its influence:

Bach's insistence on the tonal system and contribution to shaping it did not imply he was less at ease with the older modal system and the genres associated with it: more than his contemporaries (who had "moved on" to the tonal system without much exception), he often returned to the then-antiquated modes and genres. His
Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue
, emulating the
chromatic fantasia
genre used by earlier composers such as
John Dowland
and
Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck
in D
Dorian mode
(comparable to
D minor
in the tonal system), is an example. Bach's first biographer,
Johann Nikolaus Forkel
, wrote of Bach's original approach to this: "I have expended much effort to find another piece of this type by Bach. But it was in vain. This fantasy is unique and has always been second to none."
[
156
]

Modulation
, or changing
key
in the course of a piece, is another style characteristic where Bach goes beyond the norm in his time. Baroque instruments vastly limited modulation possibilities: keyboard instruments, before a workable system of
temperament
, limited the keys that could be modulated to, and wind instruments, especially brass instruments such as
trumpets
and
horns
, about a century before they were fitted with valves and
crooks
, were tied to the key of their tuning. Bach pushed the limits: he added "strange tones" in his organ playing, confusing the singers, according to an indictment he had to face in Arnstadt,
[
138
]
and
Louis Marchand
, another early experimenter with modulation, seems to have avoided confrontation with Bach because the latter went further than anyone had done before.
[
157
]
In the "
Suscepit Israel
" of his 1723 Magnificat, he had the trumpets in E-flat play a melody in the
enharmonic
scale of C minor.
[
158
]

The major development in Bach's time to which he contributed in no small way was a temperament for keyboard instruments that allowed their use in every key (12 major and 12 minor) and also modulation without retuning. His
Capriccio on the departure of a beloved brother
, a very early work, showed a gusto for modulation unlike any contemporary work it has been compared to,
[
159
]
but the full expansion came with
The Well-Tempered Clavier
, using all keys, which Bach apparently had been developing since around 1720, the
Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach
being one of its earliest examples.
[
160
]

The second page of the
Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach
is an
ornament
notation and performance guide that Bach wrote for his then nine-year-old eldest son. Bach was generally quite specific on ornamentation in his compositions (in his time, much ornamentation was not written out by composers but rather considered a liberty of the performer),
[
139
]
and his ornamentation was often quite elaborate. For instance, the "Aria" of the
Goldberg Variations
has rich ornamentation in nearly every measure. Bach's approach to ornamentation can also be seen in a keyboard arrangement he made of Marcello's
Oboe Concerto
: he added explicit ornamentation, which centuries later is still played.
[
161
]

Although Bach wrote no operas, he was not averse to the genre or its ornamented vocal style. In church music, Italian composers had imitated the operatic vocal style in genres such as the
Neapolitan mass
. In Protestant surroundings, there was more reluctance to adopt such a style for liturgical music. Kuhnau had notoriously shunned opera and Italian virtuoso vocal music.
[
162
]
Bach was less moved. After a performance of his
St Matthew Passion
it was described as sounding like opera.
[
163
]

In concerted playing in Bach's time, the basso continuo, consisting of instruments such as
viola da gamba
or cello, and harpsichord or organ, usually had the role of accompaniment, providing a piece's harmonic and rhythmic foundation. Beginning in the 1720s Bach had the organ play
concertante
(i.e., as a soloist) with the orchestra in instrumental cantata movements,
[
164
]
a decade before Handel published his
first organ concertos
.
[
165
]
Apart from the
fifth
Brandenburg Concerto
and the
Triple Concerto
, which already had harpsichord soloists in the 1720s, Bach wrote and arranged his harpsichord concertos in the 1730s,
[
166
]
and in his sonatas for viola da gamba and harpsichord neither instrument plays a continuo part: they are treated as equal soloists, far beyond the figured bass. In this way, Bach played a key role in the development of genres such as the keyboard concerto.
[
140
]

Bach wrote virtuoso music for specific instruments as well as music independent of instrumentation. For instance, the
sonatas and partitas for solo violin
are considered among the finest works written for violin, within reach of only accomplished players. The music fits the instrument, using the full gamut of its possibilities and requiring virtuosity but without
bravura
.
[
141
]
Notwithstanding that the music and the instrument seem inseparable, Bach transcribed some pieces in this collection for other instruments. For example, Bach transcribed one of the
cello suites
for lute.
[
167
]
In this sense, it is no surprise that Bach's music is easily and often performed on instruments it was not written for, that it is
transcribed
so often, and that his melodies turn up in unexpected places, such as jazz music. Apart from this, Bach left several compositions without specified instrumentation: the canons
BWV 1072–1078
are in that category, as is the bulk of the
Musical Offering
and the
Art of Fugue
.
[
168
]

Another characteristic of Bach's style is his extensive use of
counterpoint
, as opposed to the
homophony
used in his four-part chorale settings, for example. Bach's canons, and especially his fugues, are the most characteristic of this style, which he did not invent but contributed to so fundamentally as to influence many followers.
[
169
]
Fugues are as characteristic of Bach's style as, for instance,
sonata form
is of the composers of the
Classical period
.
[
142
]

These strictly contrapuntal compositions, and most of Bach's music in general, are characterised by distinct melodic lines for each voice, where the chords formed by the notes sounding at a given point follow the rules of four-part harmony. Forkel, Bach's first biographer, gives this description of this feature of Bach's music, which sets it apart from most other music:

Bach devoted more attention than his contemporaries to the structure of his compositions. This can be seen in minor adjustments he made when adapting someone else's work, such as his earliest version of the
"Keiser"
St Mark Passion
, where he enhances scene transitions,
[
171
]
and in the architecture of his own work, such as his
Magnificat
[
158
]
and
Leipzig Passions
. In his last years, Bach revised several of his compositions, sometimes by recasting them in an enhanced structure for emphasis, as with, for example, the
Mass in B minor
. Bach's known preoccupation with structure led to various numerological analyses of his compositions.  These peaked around the 1970s. Many were later rejected, especially those that wandered into symbolism-ridden
hermeneutics
.
[
172
]
[
173
]

The
librettos
, or lyrics, of his vocal compositions played an essential role for Bach. He sought collaboration with various text authors for his cantatas and major vocal compositions, possibly writing or adapting such texts himself to make them fit the structure of the composition when he could not rely on the talents of other text authors. His collaboration with
Picander
for the
St Matthew Passion
libretto is best known, but there was a similar process in achieving a multi-layered structure for his
St John Passion
libretto a few years earlier.
[
174
]
[
175
]

Among the compositional techniques Bach used, the form of the fugue recurs throughout his lifetime; a
fugue
(derives from the Latin with the meaning "flight" or "escape"
[
176
]
) is a
contrapuntal
,
polyphonic
compositional technique
in two or more
voices
, built on a
subject
(a musical theme) introduced at the beginning in
imitation
(repetition at different pitches), which recurs frequently throughout the composition. Most fugues open with the subject,
[
177
]
which then sounds successively in each
voice
. When each voice has completed its entry of the subject, the
exposition
is complete. This is often followed by a connecting passage, or
episode
, developed from previously heard material; further "entries" of the subject are then heard in
related keys
. Episodes (if applicable) and entries are usually alternated until the final entry of the subject, at which point the music has returned to the opening key, or
tonic
, which is often followed by a
coda
.
[
178
]
[
179
]
[
180
]
Bach was well known for his fugues and shaped his own works after those of
Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck
,
Johann Jakob Froberger
,
Johann Pachelbel
,
Girolamo Frescobaldi
,
Dieterich Buxtehude
and others.
[
181
]

In his early youth, Bach copied pieces by other composers to learn from them.
[
182
]
Later, he copied and arranged music for performance or as study material for his pupils. Some of these pieces, like "
Bist du bei mir
" (copied not by Bach but by Anna Magdalena), became famous before being associated with Bach. Bach copied and arranged Italian masters such as Vivaldi (e.g.
BWV 1065
),
Pergolesi
(
BWV 1083
) and
Palestrina
(
Missa Sine nomine
), French masters such as
François Couperin
(
BWV Anh. 183
), and various German masters, including Telemann (e.g.
BWV 824
=
TWV 32:14
) and Handel (
arias from
Brockes Passion
), and music by members of his own family. He also often copied and arranged his own music (e.g. movements from cantatas for his short masses
BWV 233–236
), as his music was likewise copied and arranged by others. Some of these arrangements, like the late 19th-century "
Air on the G String
", helped to popularise Bach's music.
[
183
]
[
184
]
[
185
]

The question of "who copied whom" is sometimes unclear. For instance, Forkel mentions a Mass for double chorus among Bach's works. It was published and performed in the early 19th century. Although a score partially in Bach's handwriting exists, the work was later considered spurious.
[
186
]
In 1950, the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis was designed to keep such works out of the main catalogue; if there was a strong association with Bach, they could be listed in its appendix (German:
Anhang
, abbreviated as Anh.). Thus, for instance, the Mass for double chorus became
BWV Anh. 167
. But this was far from the end of the attribution problems. For instance,
Schlage doch, gewünschte Stunde, BWV 53
, was later attributed to
Melchior Hoffmann
. For other works, Bach's authorship was put in doubt: the best-known organ composition in the BWV catalogue, the
Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565
, was one of these uncertain works in the late 20th century.
[
187
]

In the 18th century Bach's music was appreciated mostly by distinguished connoisseurs. The 19th century started with the publication of the first biography of Bach and ended with the
Bach Gesellschaft
's completion and publication of all his known works. Starting with the
Bach Revival
, he began to be regarded as one of the greatest composers, a reputation he has maintained. The
BACH motif
, which Bach occasionally used in his compositions, has been used in dozens of tributes to him since the 19th century.
[
188
]

In his own time, Bach was highly regarded by his colleagues,
[
189
]
but his reputation outside this small circle of connoisseurs was due not to his compositions (which had an extremely narrow circulation),
[
16
]
but to his virtuosic abilities. Nevertheless, during his life, Bach received public recognition, such as the title of court composer by
Augustus III of Poland
and the appreciation he was shown by
Frederick the Great
and
Hermann Karl von Keyserling
. This appreciation contrasted with the humiliations he faced, for instance, in Leipzig.
[
190
]
Bach also had detractors in the contemporary press (
Johann Adolf Scheibe
suggested he write less complex music) and supporters, such as
Johann Mattheson
and
Lorenz Christoph Mizler
.
[
191
]
[
192
]
[
193
]
After his death, Bach's reputation as a composer initially declined: his work was regarded as old-fashioned compared to the emerging
galant
style.
[
194
]
He was remembered more as a virtuoso organ player and a teacher. The bulk of the music
printed during his lifetime
was for organ or harpsichord.
[
46
]

Bach's surviving family members, who inherited many of his manuscripts, were not all equally concerned with preserving them, leading to considerable losses.
[
195
]
Carl Philipp Emanuel
, his second-eldest son, was most active in safeguarding his father's legacy: he co-authored his father's obituary, contributed to the publication of his four-part chorales,
[
196
]
presented some of his works, and helped preserve the bulk of his previously unpublished work.
[
197
]
[
198
]
Later, just after the turn of the century in 1805,
Abraham Mendelssohn
, who had married one of Itzig's granddaughters, bought a substantial collection of Bach manuscripts that had come down from C. P. E. Bach, and donated it to the
Berlin Sing-Akademie
.
[
199
]

Wilhelm Friedemann
, the eldest son, performed several of his father's cantatas in
Halle
but, after becoming unemployed, sold part of his large collection of his father's works.
[
200
]
[
201
]
[
202
]
Several
students of Bach
, such as his son-in-law
Johann Christoph Altnickol
,
Johann Friedrich Agricola
,
Johann Kirnberger
, and
Johann Ludwig Krebs
, contributed to the dissemination of his legacy. The early devotees were not all musicians; for example, in Berlin,
Daniel Itzig
, a high official of Frederick the Great's court, venerated Bach.
[
203
]
His eldest daughters took lessons from Kirnberger and their sister Sara from
Wilhelm Friedemann Bach
, who was in Berlin from 1774 to 1784.
[
203
]
[
204
]
Sara Itzig Levy
became an avid collector of work by J. S. Bach and his sons and was a patron of C. P. E. Bach.
[
204
]

While Bach was in Leipzig, performances of his church music were limited to some of his motets and, under his student cantor
Johann Friedrich Doles
, some of
his Passions
.
[
205
]
A new generation of Bach aficionados emerged who studiously collected and copied his music, including some of his large-scale works, such as the
Mass in B minor
, and performed it privately. One was
Gottfried van Swieten
, a high-ranking Austrian official who was instrumental in passing Bach's legacy on to the composers of the
Viennese school
.
Haydn
owned manuscript copies of
The Well-Tempered Clavier
and the Mass in B minor and was influenced by Bach's music.
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
owned a copy of one of Bach's motets,
[
206
]
transcribed some of his instrumental works (Preludes and Fugues for Violin, Viola and Cello, K. 404a (1782), Fugues for 2 Violins, Viola and Cello, K. 405 (1782)),
[
207
]
[
208
]
and wrote contrapuntal music influenced by his style.
[
209
]
[
210
]
Ludwig van Beethoven
had learned
The Well-Tempered Clavier
in its entirety by the time he was 11 in 1781 and called Bach the
Urvater der Harmonie
(progenitor of harmony).
[
5
]
[
211
]
[
212
]
[
213
]
[
214
]

In 1802
Johann Nikolaus Forkel
published
Johann Sebastian Bach: His Life, Art, and Work
, the first Bach biography, dedicated to van Swieten.
[
215
]
In 1805,
Abraham Mendelssohn
bought a substantial collection of Bach manuscripts that had come down from C. P. E. Bach, and donated it to the Berlin Sing-Akademie.
[
203
]
The Sing-Akademie occasionally performed Bach's works in public concerts, for instance, his
first keyboard concerto
, with Sara Itzig Levy at the piano.
[
203
]
Since the 19th-century
Bach Revival
, he has been widely regarded as one of the greatest composers in the history of Western music.
[
216
]

The first decades of the 19th century saw an increasing number of first publications of Bach's music:
Breitkopf & Härtel
started publishing chorale preludes,
[
217
]
Hoffmeister harpsichord music,
[
218
]
and
The Well-Tempered Clavier
was printed concurrently by
N. Simrock
(Germany),
Hans Georg Nägeli
(Switzerland) and
Franz Anton Hoffmeister
(Germany and Austria) in 1801.
[
219
]
Vocal music was also published: motets in 1802 and 1803, followed by the
E
♭
major version of the Magnificat
, the
Kyrie-Gloria Mass in A major
, and the cantata
Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott
(BWV 80).
[
220
]
In 1818 the publisher
Hans Georg Nägeli
called the Mass in B minor the greatest composition ever.
[
5
]
Bach's influence was felt in the next generation of early Romantic composers.
[
211
]
Abraham's son Felix, aged 13, produced his first Magnificat setting in 1822, and it is clearly inspired by the then-unpublished D major version of Bach's Magnificat.
[
221
]

Felix Mendelssohn
's 1829 performance of the
St Matthew Passion
precipitated the Bach Revival.
[
222
]
The
St John Passion
saw its 19th-century premiere in 1833, and the first public performance of the Mass in B minor followed in 1844. Besides these and other public performances and increased coverage of the composer and his compositions in printed media, the 1830s and 1840s also saw the first publication of more Bach vocal works: six cantatas, the
St Matthew Passion
, and the Mass in B minor. A series of organ compositions were first published in 1833.
[
223
]
Frédéric Chopin
started composing his
24 Preludes, Op. 28
, inspired by
The Well-Tempered Clavier
,
[
224
]
in 1835, and
Robert Schumann
published his
Sechs Fugen über den Namen BACH
[
de
]
in 1845. Bach's music was transcribed and arranged to suit contemporary tastes and performance practice by composers such as
Carl Friedrich Zelter
,
Robert Franz
, and
Franz Liszt
, or combined with new music such as the melody line of
Charles Gounod
's "
Ave Maria
".
[
5
]
[
225
]

In 1850 the
Bach-Gesellschaft
(Bach Society) was founded to promote Bach's music. The Society chose
Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern, BWV 1
as the first composition in the first volume of the
Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe
(BGA).
Robert Schumann
, the publisher of the
Neue Zeitschrift für Musik
, Thomaskantor
Moritz Hauptmann

Otto Jahn

Its first volume was published in 1851, edited by Hauptmann.
[

In the second half of the 19th century, the Society published a comprehensive edition of his works. In 1854, Bach was deemed one of the
Three Bs
by
Peter Cornelius
, the others being Beethoven and
Hector Berlioz
. (
Hans von Bülow
later replaced Berlioz with Brahms.) From 1873 to 1880
Philipp Spitta
published
Johann Sebastian Bach
, the standard work on Bach's life and music.
[
229
]
During the 19th century, 200 books were published on Bach. By the end of the century, local Bach societies were established in several cities, and his music had been performed in all major musical centres.

In 19th-century Germany, Bach was coupled with nationalist feeling. In England, Bach was coupled with a revival of religious and Baroque music. By the end of the century, Bach was firmly established as one of the greatest composers, recognised for both his instrumental and his vocal music.

During the 20th century, recognition of the musical and
pedagogic
value of Bach's works continued, as in the promotion of the
cello suites
by
Pablo Casals
, the first major performer to record them.
[

Claude Debussy
called Bach a "benevolent God" "to whom musicians should offer a prayer before setting to work so that they may be preserved from mediocrity."

Glenn Gould
's debut
1955 recording
of the
Goldberg Variations
transformed the work from an obscure piece often considered "esoteric" to part of the standard piano repertoire.
[

]
The album had "astonishing" sales for a classical work: it was reported to have sold 40,000 copies by 1960, and had sold more than 100,000 by the time of Gould's death in 1982.

Andres Segovia
left behind a large body of edited works and transcriptions for classical guitar, notably a transcription of the
Chaconne
from the
2nd Partita for Violin (BWV 1004)
.

A significant development in the later 20th century was
historically informed performance
practice, with forerunners such as
Nikolaus Harnoncourt
acquiring prominence through their performances of Bach's music.
[
236
]
Bach's keyboard music was again performed on the
harpsichord
and other Baroque instruments rather than on modern pianos and 19th-century romantic organs. Ensembles playing and singing Bach's music not only kept to the instruments and the performance style of his day but were also reduced to the size of the groups Bach used for his performances.
[
237
]
But that was not the only way Bach's music came to the forefront in the 20th century: his music was heard in versions ranging from
Ferruccio Busoni
's late-romantic
Bach-Busoni Editions
for piano to the orchestrations of
Leopold Stokowski
, whose interpretation of the
Toccata and Fugue in D minor
opened
Disney
's
Fantasia
film.

Bach's music has influenced other genres.
Jazz
musicians have adapted it, with
Jacques Loussier
,
[
239
]
Ian Anderson
,
Uri Caine
, and the
Modern Jazz Quartet
among those creating jazz versions of his works.
[

]
Several 20th-century composers referred to Bach or his music, for example
Eugène Ysaÿe
in
Six Sonatas for solo violin
,
[
241
]
Dmitri Shostakovich
in
24 Preludes and Fugues
,
[
242
]
and
Heitor Villa-Lobos
in
Bachianas Brasileiras
(tr.
Bach-inspired Brazilian pieces
). A wide variety of publications involved Bach: there were the
Bach Jahrbuch
publications of the
Neue Bachgesellschaft
and various other biographies and studies by, among others,
Albert Schweitzer
,
Charles Sanford Terry
,
Alfred Dürr
,
Christoph Wolff
,
Peter Williams
, and
John Butt
,
[
n 3
]
and the 1950 first edition of the
Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis
. Books such as
Gödel, Escher, Bach
put the composer's art in a wider perspective. Bach's music was extensively listened to, performed, broadcast, arranged, adapted, and commented upon in the 1990s.
[
243

Around 2000, the 250th anniversary of Bach's death, three record companies issued box sets of recordings of his complete works.

Three works by Bach are featured on the
Voyager Golden Record
, a gramophone record containing a broad sample of the images, sounds, languages, and music of Earth, sent into space with the two
Voyager
probes: the first movement of
Brandenburg Concerto
No. 2
(conducted by
Karl Richter
), the "Gavotte en rondeaux" from the
Partita for Violin No. 3
(played by
Arthur Grumiaux
), and the Prelude and Fugue No. 1 in C major from
The Well-Tempered Clavier
(played by Glenn Gould).

A multitude of musical ensembles, such as the
Bach Aria Group
,
Deutsche Bachsolisten
,
Bachchor Stuttgart
, and
Bach Collegium Japan
took the composer's name.
Bach festivals
were held on several continents, and competitions and prizes such as the
International Johann Sebastian Bach Competition
and the
Royal Academy of Music Bach Prize
were named after him. While by the end of the 19th century, Bach had been inscribed in nationalism and religious revival, the late 20th century saw Bach as the subject of a secularised art-as-religion (
Kunstreligion
).

In 2011
Anthony Tommasini
, chief classical music critic of
The New York Times
, ranked Bach the greatest composer of all time, "for his matchless combination of masterly musical engineering (as one reader put it) and profound expressivity. Since writing about Bach in the first article of this series I have been thinking more about the perception that he was considered old-fashioned in his day. Haydn was 18 when Bach died, in 1750, and Classicism was stirring. Bach was surely aware of the new trends. Yet he reacted by digging deeper into his way of doing things. In his austerely beautiful
Art of Fugue,
left incomplete at his death, Bach reduced complex counterpoint to its bare essentials, not even indicating the instrument (or instruments) for which these works were composed... through his chorales alone Bach explored the far reaches of tonal harmony."
[
252
]

Alex Ross
wrote, "Bach became an absolute master of his art by never ceasing to be a student of it. His most exalted sacred works—the two extant Passions, from the seventeen-twenties, and the Mass in B Minor, completed not long before his death in 1750—are feats of synthesis, mobilizing secular devices to spiritual ends. They are rooted in archaic chants, hymns, and chorales. They honour, with consummate skill, the scholastic discipline of canon and fugue... Their furious development of brief motifs anticipates Beethoven, who worshipped Bach when he was young. And their most daring harmonic adventures—for example, the otherworldly modulations in the 'Confiteor' of the B-Minor Mass—look ahead to
Wagner
, even to
Schoenberg
."

The
liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church
has a
feast day
for Bach on 28 July;
[
254
]
on the same day, the
Calendar of Saints
of some
Lutheran churches
, such as the
ELCA
, remembers Bach, Handel, and
Heinrich Schütz
.

As of 2013 over 150 recordings have been made of
The Well-Tempered Clavier
.
[

In 2015 Bach's handwritten personal copy of the Mass in B minor, held by the
Berlin State Library
, was added to
UNESCO
's
Memory of the World Register
.

On March 21, 2019, Bach was celebrated in an interactive
Google Doodle
that used machine learning to synthesize a tune in his signature style.
