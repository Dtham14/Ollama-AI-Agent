## Biography

Giuseppe Domenico Scarlatti
(26 October 1685 – 23 July 1757) was an Italian composer. He is classified primarily as a
Baroque
composer chronologically, although his music was influential in the development of the
Classical style
. Like his renowned father
Alessandro Scarlatti
, he composed in a variety of musical forms, although today he is known mainly for
his 555 keyboard sonatas
.
[

]
He spent much of his life in the service of the Portuguese and Spanish royal families.

Scarlatti was born in
Naples
,
Kingdom of Naples
, then belonging to the
Spanish Empire
. He was born in 1685, the same year as
Johann Sebastian Bach
and
George Frideric Handel
.
[

He was the sixth of ten children of the composer and teacher
Alessandro Scarlatti
. His older brother
Pietro Filippo
was also a musician.

Scarlatti first studied music under his father.
[

Although his early musical education is unclear, he may have studied under
Gaetano Greco
,
Francesco Gasparini
, and
Bernardo Pasquini
. Scarlatti was appointed as a composer and
organist
at the
Chapel Royal of Naples
in 1701 and briefly worked under his father, who was then the chapel's
maestro di cappella
. In 1703 he revised
Carlo Francesco Pollarolo
's opera
Irene
for performance at Naples. Soon after, his father sent him to
Venice
.

After this, nothing is certain of his life until 1709, when he went to Rome and entered the service of the exiled Polish queen
Marie Casimire
.
[

]
She employed him as her maestro di cappella, where he composed the music for operas and serenatas.
[

]
Some of these works include including
Tolomeo e Alessandro
(1711) and
Amor d'un'ombra e gelosia d'un'aura
(1714) specially for Queen Casimir's private theatre. He also made religious works like a Stabat mater for ten voices. When the exiled queen ran out of money and left Italy, Scarlatti became a musical director at the Julian Chapel at St. Peter’s from 1714 to 1719.

In 1719 he travelled to London to direct Amor d'un'ombra e gelosia d'un'aura under the title Narciso at the King's Theatre. While in Rome he met Thomas Roseingrave, who would later describe his harpsichord skills to Charles Burney. Scarlatti was already an accomplished harpsichordist; there is a story of a trial of skill with
George Frideric Handel
at the palace of Cardinal Ottoboni in Rome, where Scarlatti was judged possibly superior to Handel on the harpsichord, although inferior on the organ. Later in life, he was known to cross himself in veneration when speaking of Handel's skill.

In September 1719, Scarlatti abandoned his post at the Vatican, and, according to Vicente Bicchi, the Papal Nuncio in Portugal at the time, he arrived in Lisbon on 29 November 1719.
[

There, he became musical director to
King John V of Portugal
, as well as music master to the king’s younger brother, Don Antonio, and Princess Maria Magdalena Barbara. He also knew and probably met the 16-year-old
Carlos Seixas
, who was also at the court of John V.

Scarlatti left Lisbon on 28 January 1727 for Rome, where he married Maria Caterina Gentili on 6 May 1728.
[

]
She was 16, he was 42. The two of them had six children. In 1729, he moved to Seville, where he stayed for 4 years.

In 1733, he travelled to Madrid as a music master to Princess Maria Barbara, who had married into the Spanish royal house.
[

]
She later became Queen of Spain. Scarlatti remained in Spain for the remaining 25 years of his life. After his wife died in 1739, he married a Spaniard, Anastasia Maxarti Ximenes, and had four more kids with her. Among his compositions during his time in Madrid were most of the 555 keyboard sonatas for which he is best known. While in Spain, he released his only musical publication, Esercizi per gravicembalo, in 1738, which contained 30 keyboard sonatas.

Scarlatti befriended the
castrato
singer
Farinelli
, a fellow Neapolitan also enjoying royal patronage in Madrid. Musicologist and harpsichordist
Ralph Kirkpatrick
, who published a biography of Scarlatti in 1953, commented that Farinelli's correspondence provides "most of the direct information about Scarlatti that has transmitted itself to our day".

Scarlatti died in Madrid at the age of 71. His residence at 35 Calle de Leganitos is designated with a historical plaque, and his descendants still live in Madrid. He was buried at a convent there, but his grave no longer exists.

Minor planet
6480 Scarlatti
is named in his honour.

Only a small number of Scarlatti's compositions were published during his lifetime. Scarlatti himself seems to have overseen the publication in 1738 of the most famous collection, his 30
Esercizi
(Exercises). They were well received throughout Europe and were championed by the foremost English writer on music of the eighteenth century,
Charles Burney
. Burney wrote that the harpsichordist
Joseph Kelway
was "head of the Scarlatti sect", a group of English musicians that championed Scarlatti as early as 1739, also including
Thomas Roseingrave
.

The many sonatas unpublished during Scarlatti's lifetime have appeared in print irregularly in the past two and a half centuries. He has attracted notable admirers, including
Béla Bartók
,
Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli
,
Pieter-Jan Belder
,
Johann Sebastian Bach
,
Muzio Clementi
,
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
,
Ludwig van Beethoven
,
Carl Czerny

Franz Liszt

Johannes Brahms

Frédéric Chopin
,
Claude Debussy

Emil Gilels
,
Francis Poulenc
,
Olivier Messiaen
,
Enrique Granados
,
Marc-André Hamelin
,
Vladimir Horowitz
,
Ivo Pogorelić
,
Scott Ross
(the first performer to record all 555 sonatas),
Heinrich Schenker
,
András Schiff
and
Dmitri Shostakovich
.

Scarlatti's 555 keyboard sonatas are single movements, mostly in
binary form
, and some in early
sonata form
, and mostly written for
harpsichord
or the earliest
pianofortes
. (There are four for the organ and a few for small instrumental groups). Some display harmonic audacity in their use of discords, and unconventional
modulations
to remote
keys
.

Though Scarlatti wrote over 500 sonatas, there is a wide variety in his works. Some are deeply serious, others are light and almost humorous. Some sound like courtly dances, others like street songs. This ability to cover a wide range of styles and moods is one of the hallmarks of Scarlatti's work. Another stylistic trait of this composer is the ability to mix “different forms or levels of discourse”.

Kirkpatrick produced an edition of the sonatas in 1953, and the numbering from this edition—the Kk. or K. number—is now nearly always used. Previously, the numbering commonly used was from the 1906 edition compiled by Neapolitan pianist
Alessandro Longo
(L. numbers). Kirkpatrick's numbering is chronological, while Longo's ordering is a result of his arbitrarily grouping the sonatas into "suites". In 1967 the Italian musicologist
Giorgio Pestelli
published a revised catalogue (using P. numbers), which corrected what he considered to be some
anachronisms
, and added some sonatas missing from Kirkpatrick's edition.
[

Although the exact composition dates for these surviving sonatas are not known, Kirkpatrick concluded that they might all have been composed late in Scarlatti's career (after 1735), with most of them possibly written after the composer's 67th birthday.

Aside from his many sonatas, Scarlatti composed several operas, cantatas, and liturgical pieces. Well-known works include the
Stabat Mater
of 1715, and the
Salve Regina
of 1756, which is thought to be his last composition.
