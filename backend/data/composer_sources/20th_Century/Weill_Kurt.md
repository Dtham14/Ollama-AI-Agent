## Biography

Kurt Julian Weill
(
/
w
aɪ
l
/
;
[
1
]
German:
[vaɪl]
; March 2, 1900 – April 3, 1950) was a German-born American composer
[
a
]
[
3
]
active from the 1920s in his native country, and in his later years in the United States.
[
4
]
He was a leading composer for the stage who was best known for his fruitful collaborations with
Bertolt Brecht
. With Brecht, he wrote his best-known work,
The Threepenny Opera
, which includes the ballad "
Mack the Knife
". Weill held the ideal of writing music that served a socially useful purpose,
[
5
]
Gebrauchsmusik
.
[
6
]
He also wrote several works for the concert hall and a number of works on Jewish themes. He fled Nazi Germany in 1933, arriving in the United States two years later. Settling in New York, he made a substantial contribution to American musical theater through works such as
Lady in the Dark
and
Street Scene
.

Weill was born on March 2, 1900,
[
7
]
the third of four children to Albert Weill (1867–1950) and Emma Weill (née Ackermann; 1872–1955). He grew up in a religious
Jewish
family in the "Sandvorstadt", the Jewish quarter in
Dessau
in
Saxony
, where his father was a
cantor
.
[
8
]
At the age of twelve, Weill started taking piano lessons and made his first attempts at writing music; his earliest preserved composition was written in 1913 and is titled "
Mi Addir
: Jewish Wedding Song".
[
9
]

In 1915, Weill started taking private lessons with Albert Bing,
kapellmeister
at the "Herzogliches Hoftheater zu Dessau", who taught him piano, composition, music theory, and conducting. Weill performed publicly on piano for the first time in 1915, both as an accompanist and soloist. The following years he composed numerous
lieder
to the lyrics of poets such as
Joseph von Eichendorff
,
Arno Holz
, and
Anna Ritter
, as well as a cycle of five songs titled
Ofrahs Lieder
to a German translation of a text by
Yehuda Halevi
.
[
10
]

Weill graduated with an
Abitur
from the
Oberrealschule
of Dessau in 1918, and enrolled at the
Berliner Hochschule für Musik
at the age of 18, where he studied composition with
Engelbert Humperdinck
,
[
8
]
conducting
with
Rudolf Krasselt
, and
counterpoint
with
Friedrich E. Koch
, and also attended philosophy lectures by
Max Dessoir
and
Ernst Cassirer
. The same year, he wrote his first
string quartet
(in B minor).
[
11
]

Weill's family experienced financial hardship in the aftermath of World War I, and in July 1919, Weill abandoned his studies and returned to Dessau, where he was employed as a
répétiteur
at the Friedrich-Theater under the direction of the new
Kapellmeister
,
Hans Knappertsbusch
. During this time, he composed an
orchestral suite
in E-flat major, a
symphonic poem
on
Rainer Maria Rilke
's
The Lay of the Love and Death of Cornet Christopher Rilke
, and
Schilflieder
("Reed Songs"), a
cycle
of five songs to poems by
Nikolaus Lenau
. In December 1919, through the help of Humperdinck, Weill was appointed as Kapellmeister at the newly founded Stadttheater in
Lüdenscheid
, where he directed opera, operetta, and
singspiel
for five months. He subsequently composed a
cello sonata
and
Ninon de Lenclos
, a now lost
one-act
operatic adaptation of a 1905 play by
Ernst Hardt
. From May to September 1920, Weill spent a few months in
Leipzig
, where his father had become the director of a Jewish orphanage, residing in the
Gottschedstrasse
. Before he returned to Berlin, in September 1920, he composed
Sulamith
, a choral fantasy for soprano, female choir, and orchestra.

Back in Berlin, Weill had an interview with
Ferruccio Busoni
in December 1920. After examining some of Weill's compositions, Busoni accepted him as one of five master students in composition at the
Preussische Akademie der Künste
in Berlin.
[
12
]

From January 1921 to December 1923, Weill studied music composition with him and also counterpoint with
Philipp Jarnach
in Berlin. During his first year he composed his first
symphony
,
Sinfonie in einem Satz
, as well as the lieder
Die Bekehrte
(
Goethe
) and two
Rilkelieder
for voice and piano.
[
13
]
Busoni, then approaching the end of his life, was a major influence on Weill. Where Weill's early compositions reflect the post-
Wagnerian
Romanticism
and
Expressionism
common in German classical music of that era, Busoni was a
Neoclassicist
. Busoni's influence can be seen especially in Weill's vocal and stage works, which moved steadily away from having the music reflect the characters' emotions to have it function as (often ironic) commentary. This was Weill's own path to some of the same notions of
Epic theater
and the
Verfremdungseffekt
(
distancing effect
) advocated by his future collaborator Brecht.
[
14
]

To support his family in Leipzig, Weill also worked as a pianist in a Bierkeller tavern. In 1922, Weill joined the
November Group
's music faction. That year he composed a psalm, a
divertimento
for orchestra, and
Sinfonia Sacra: Fantasia, Passacaglia, and Hymnus for Orchestra
. On November 18, 1922, his children's
pantomime
Die Zaubernacht
(
The Magic Night
) premiered at the Theater am Kurfürstendamm; it was the first public performance of any of Weill's works in the field of musical theatre.
[
13
]

Out of financial need, Weill taught music theory and composition to private students from 1923 to 1925. Among his students were
Claudio Arrau
,
Maurice Abravanel
,
Heinz Jolles (later known as Henry Jolles)
,
[
15
]
Nikos Skalkottas
, and
Esther Zweig
.
[
16
]
Arrau, Abravanel, and Jolles remained members of Weill's circle of friends thereafter,
[
17
]
and Jolles's sole surviving composition predating the rise of the
Nazi
regime in 1933 is a fragment of a work for four pianos he and Weill wrote jointly.
[
15
]

Weill's compositions during his last year of studies included
Quodlibet
, an orchestral suite version of
Die Zaubernacht
;
Frauentanz
, seven medieval poems for soprano, flute, viola, clarinet, French horn, and bassoon; and
Recordare
for choir and children's choir to words from the
Book of Lamentations
. Further premieres that year included a performance of his
Divertimento for Orchestra
by the
Berlin Philharmonic
under the direction of
Heinz Unger
on April 10, 1923, and the
Hindemith-Amar Quartet
's rendering of Weill's
String Quartet
, Op. 8, on June 24, 1923. In December 1923, Weill finished his studies with Busoni.
[
18
]

In 1922 he joined the
Novembergruppe
, a group of
leftist
Berlin artists that included
Hanns Eisler
and
Stefan Wolpe
.
[
19
]
In February 1924 the conductor
Fritz Busch
introduced him to the dramatist
Georg Kaiser
, with whom Weill would have a long-lasting creative partnership resulting in several one-act operas. At Kaiser's house in
Grünheide
, Weill first met the singer and actress
Lotte Lenya
in the summer of 1924.
[
20
]
The couple were married twice: in 1926 and again in 1937 (after their divorce in 1933). She took great care to support Weill's work, and after his death she took it upon herself to increase awareness of his music, forming the
Kurt Weill Foundation
. From November 1924 to May 1929, Weill wrote hundreds of reviews for the influential and comprehensive radio program guide
Der deutsche Rundfunk
; Hans Siebert von Heister had already worked with Weill in the November Group, and offered Weill the job shortly after becoming editor-in-chief.
[
21
]

Although he had some success with his first mature non-stage works (such as the String Quartet, Op. 8, and the Concerto for Violin and Wind Orchestra, Op. 12), which were influenced by
Gustav Mahler
,
Arnold Schoenberg
and
Igor Stravinsky
, Weill tended more and more towards vocal music and musical theatre. His musical theatre work and his songs were extremely popular in Germany in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Weill's music was admired by composers such as
Alban Berg
,
Alexander von Zemlinsky
,
Darius Milhaud
and Stravinsky, but it was also criticized by others: Schoenberg, who later revised his opinion, and
Anton Webern
.

His best-known work is
The Threepenny Opera
(1928), a reworking of
John Gay
's
The Beggar's Opera
, written in collaboration with
Bertolt Brecht
. Engel directed the original production of
The Threepenny Opera
in 1928. It contains Weill's most famous song, "
Mack the Knife
" ("
Die Moritat von Mackie Messer
").
[
22
]
Textually
Threepenny Opera
—like the
Beggar's Opera
before it—is satire and social commentary;
[
23
]
but for Weill, coming from a musical perspective, it was something else as well: "It gives us the opportunity to make opera the subject matter for an evening in the theater",
[
24
]
part of what Weill saw as a lifelong process to "reform" opera for the modern stage.
[
25
]
The stage success was filmed by
G. W. Pabst
in two language versions:
Die 3-Groschen-Oper
and
L'opéra de quat' sous
. Weill and Brecht tried to stop the film adaptation through a well publicized lawsuit—which Weill won and Brecht lost.

Weill continued to work with Brecht on the musical
Happy End
(1929), best known for the songs "Surabaya Johnny", "Bilbao Song", and "Sailor's Tango"; the children's opera
Der Jasager
(1930); and the opera
Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny
(1930), best known for "
Alabama Song
" (later recorded by
The Doors
, among many others).
[
26
]
Weill's working association with Brecht, although successful, came to an end over politics in 1930. Though Weill associated with socialism,
[
22
]
after Brecht tried to push their work even further in a left-wing direction, Weill commented, according to his wife Lotte Lenya, that he was unable to "set the
Communist Manifesto
to music."
[
27
]

While in Germany in the early 1930s, Weill also collaborated with the American virtuoso banjoist
Mike Danzi
in an early production of his opera
Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny
. During a rehearsal, Weill congratulated Danzi for his accurate interpretation of the chords found in his score while noting that most other banjoists had complained that they were not actually written for the banjo at all.
[
28
]

Weill fled
Nazi Germany
in March 1933.
[
29
]
A prominent and popular Jewish composer, Weill was officially denounced for his political views and sympathies,
[
30
]
and became a target of the Nazi authorities, who criticized and interfered with performances of his later stage works, such as
Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny
(
Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny
, 1930),
Die Bürgschaft
(1932), and
Der Silbersee
(1933). With no option but to leave Germany, he went first to Paris, where he worked once more with Brecht (after a project with
Jean Cocteau
failed) on the ballet
The Seven Deadly Sins
.

On April 13, 1933, his musical
The Threepenny Opera
was given its premiere on Broadway, but closed after 13 performances to mixed reviews.
[
7
]
In 1934 he completed his Symphony No. 2, his last purely orchestral work, conducted in Amsterdam and New York by
Bruno Walter
, and also the music for
Jacques Deval
's play
Marie Galante
[
fr
]
.
[
29
]
A production of his operetta
Der Kuhhandel
(
A Kingdom for a Cow
) took him to London in 1935, and later that year he went to the United States in connection with
The Eternal Road
,
[
8
]
a "Biblical Drama" by
Franz Werfel
that had been commissioned by members of New York's Jewish community and was premiered in 1937 at the
Manhattan Opera House
, running for 153 performances.

He and Lotte moved to New York City on September 10, 1935, living first at the St. Moritz Hotel before moving to an apartment at 231 East 62nd Street, between Third and Second Avenues.
[
7
]
They rented an old house with
Paul Green
during the summer of 1936 near
Pine Brook Country Club
in
Nichols, Connecticut
, the summer home of the
Group Theatre
, while finishing
Johnny Johnson
. Some of the other artists who summered there in 1936 were
Elia Kazan
,
Harry Morgan
,
John Garfield
,
Lee J. Cobb
,
Will Geer
,
Clifford Odets
,
Howard da Silva
and
Irwin Shaw
.

Rather than continue to write in the same style that had characterized his European compositions, Weill made a study of American popular and stage music. His American output contains individual songs and entire shows that not only became highly respected and admired, but have been seen as seminal works in the development of the American
musical
. In 1939 he wrote the music for
Railroads on Parade,
a musical spectacular put on at the
1939 World's Fair
in New York to celebrate the American railroad industry (book by Edward Hungerford). Unique among Broadway composers of the time, Weill insisted on writing his own orchestrations (with some very few exceptions, such as the dance music in
Street Scene
).
[
34
]
He worked with writers such as
Maxwell Anderson
and
Ira Gershwin
, and wrote a film score for
Fritz Lang
(
You and Me
, 1938). Weill himself strove to find a new way of creating an American opera that would be both commercially and artistically successful. The most interesting attempt in this direction is
Street Scene
, based on a play by
Elmer Rice
, with lyrics by
Langston Hughes
. For his work on
Street Scene
Weill was awarded the inaugural
Tony Award
for
Best Original Score
.
[
35
]

In the 1940s Weill lived in
downstate New York
near the
New Jersey
border and made frequent trips both to New York City and to Hollywood for his work for theatre and film. Weill was active in political movements encouraging American entry into World War II, and after America joined the war in 1941, Weill enthusiastically collaborated in numerous artistic projects supporting the war effort both abroad and on the
home front
. He and Maxwell Anderson also joined the volunteer civil service by working as air raid wardens on
High Tor Mountain
between their homes in
New City, New York
and
Haverstraw, New York
in
Rockland County
. Weill became a
naturalized citizen
of the United States on August 27, 1943.
[
8
]

Weill had ideals of writing music that served a socially useful purpose. In the US, he wrote
Down in the Valley
, an opera including the
song of the same name
and other American folk songs. He also wrote a number of songs in support of the American war effort, including the satirical "Schickelgruber" (with lyrics by
Howard Dietz
), "Buddy on the Nightshift" (with
Oscar Hammerstein
) and – with Brecht again as in his earlier career – the
"Ballad of the Nazi Soldier's Wife" ("Und was bekam des Soldaten Weib?").
Intended for broadcast to Germany, the song chronicled the progress of the Nazi war machine through the gifts sent to the proud wife at home by her man at the front: furs from Oslo, a silk dress from Paris etc., until finally, from Russia, she receives her widow's veil.
[

]

Apart from "
Mack the Knife
" and "
Pirate Jenny
" from
The Threepenny Opera
, his most famous songs include "
Alabama Song
" (from
Mahagonny
), "Surabaya Johnny" (from
Happy End
), "
Speak Low
" (from
One Touch of Venus
), "Lost in the Stars" (from
the musical of that name
), "
My Ship
" (from
Lady in the Dark
), and "
September Song
" (from
Knickerbocker Holiday
).

Weill suffered a heart attack shortly after his 50th birthday and died on April 3, 1950, in New York City.
[
29
]
He was buried in Mount Repose Cemetery in
Haverstraw, New York
. The text and music on his gravestone come from the song "A Bird of Passage" from
Lost in the Stars
, itself adapted from a quotation from the
Venerable Bede
:
[
36
]

An excerpt from Maxwell Anderson's eulogy for Weill read:

Weill's music continues to be performed both in
popular
and
classical
contexts. In Weill's lifetime, his work was most associated with the voice of his wife,
Lotte Lenya
, but shortly after his death "
Mack the Knife
" was established by
Louis Armstrong
and
Bobby Darin
as a jazz standard. His music has since been recorded by many performers, ranging from
Nina Simone
,
Judy Garland
,
Frank Sinatra
,
The Doors
,
Ella Fitzgerald
,
David Bowie
,
Robbie Williams
,
Judy Collins
,
John Zorn
,
Dagmar Krause
,
Steeleye Span
,
The Young Gods
, and
PJ Harvey
to New York's
Metropolitan Opera
and the
Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra
. Singers as varied as
Teresa Stratas
,
Ute Lemper
,
Gisela May
,
Anne Sofie von Otter
,
Max Raabe
,
Heinz Karl Gruber
,
Dee Dee Bridgewater
and
Marianne Faithfull
have recorded entire albums of his music.

In 1985,
Hal Willner
produced
Lost in the Stars: The Music of Kurt Weill
, a
tribute album
in which Weill's songs were interpreted by a variety of artists, including
Todd Rundgren
,
Tom Waits
,
Lou Reed
,
Charlie Haden
and
Sting
.
[
37
]

Amanda Palmer
, singer-pianist of the Brechtian Punk Cabaret duo
The Dresden Dolls
, has Kurt Weill's name on the front of her keyboard (a pun on the name of the instrument maker
Kurzweil
) as a tribute to the composer. In 1991, the seminal
Swiss
industrial
band
The Young Gods
released an album of Kurt Weill songs,
The Young Gods Play Kurt Weill
. Weill has also been often cited as an influence on
Goldfrapp
's
Felt Mountain
. In 2008, Weill's songs were performed by Canadian musicians (including
Sarah Slean
and
Mary Margaret O'Hara
) in a tribute concert as part of the first annual Canwest Cabaret Festival in Toronto. In 2009
Duke Special
released an EP,
Huckleberry Finn
, of five songs from an unfinished musical by Kurt Weill based on
the novel
by
Mark Twain
.

Kurt Weill is a member of the
American Theater Hall of Fame
.
[
38
]

The Kurt Weill Centre (German:
Kurt-Weill-Zentrum
) in Dessau was founded in 1993. It provides a museum, library, archive and media centre and organises an annual festival celebrating the composer's work. It is housed in the Feininger house, a house designed by the architect
Walter Gropius
which was originally lived in by the artist
Lyonel Feininger
. The property is part of the World Heritage site the
Bauhaus and its Sites in Weimar, Dessau and Bernau
. The centre, with its collection of material on Weill, is listed as a cultural memorial of national importance.
[
39
]
The centre is one of the "Beacons of light" of the
Konferenz Nationaler Kultureinrichtungen
(Conference of National Cultural Institutions), a union of cultural institutions in the
new states of Germany
i.e. area that was formerly
East Germany
.
[

]

Founded by
Lotte Lenya
in 1962, the non-profit, private foundation is dedicated to promoting understanding of Weill's life and works and preserving the legacies of Weill and Lenya. The foundation administers the internationally recognized Lotte Lenya Competition, a grant program, various sponsorships and fellowships, the Weill-Lenya Research Center, and the Kurt Weill Prize, and publishes the
Kurt Weill Edition
and the
Kurt Weill Newsletter
. Trustees of the New York-based organization have included
Harold Prince
,
Victoria Clark
,
Jeanine Tesori
,
Tazewell Thompson
, and
Teresa Stratas
.

Weill's grandmother was Jeanette Hochstetter of Liedolsheim in
Baden-Württemberg
.
[
44
]
Weill was one of four members of the same Hochstetter family to lead distinguished careers in the fields of music and literature. His first cousin once removed was
Caesar Hochstetter
(born January 12, 1863, in
Ladenburg
, a suburb of
Mannheim
– his date and place of death are unknown but this was probably during
The Holocaust
), a composer and arranger who collaborated with
Max Reger
and who dedicated
Aquarelles
, Op. 25, to him.
[
45
]

Caesar's younger brother was
Gustav Hochstetter
[
de
]
(born May 12, 1873,
Mannheim
– died 1942,
Theresienstadt concentration camp
), Professor of Literature at the University of Brussels, writer and poet and friend of
Wilhelm Busch
. His second cousin was the childhood prodigy pianist,
Lisy Fischer
(born August 22, 1900, Zürich, Switzerland – died June 6, 1999,
Newcastle upon Tyne
, England).
