## Biography

Anton Webern
[
a
]
(
German:
[ˈantoːn
ˈveːbɐn]
ⓘ
; 3 December 1883 – 15 September 1945) was an Austrian composer, conductor, and musicologist. His music was among the most radical of its
milieu
in its
lyrical
, poetic
concision
and use of then novel
atonal
and
twelve-tone
techniques. His approach was typically rigorous, inspired by his studies of the
Franco-Flemish School
under
Guido Adler
and by
Arnold Schoenberg
's emphasis on structure in teaching composition from the music of
Johann Sebastian Bach
, the
First Viennese School
, and
Johannes Brahms
. Webern, Schoenberg, and their colleague
Alban Berg
were at the core of what became known as the
Second Viennese School
.

Webern was arguably the first and certainly the last of the three to write music in an
aphoristic
and
expressionist
style, reflecting his instincts and the idiosyncrasy of his compositional process.
[
4
]
He treated themes of loss, love, nature, and spirituality, working from personal experiences. Unhappily peripatetic and often assigned
light music
or
operetta
in his early conducting career, he aspired to conduct what was seen as more respectable,
serious music
at home in Vienna. Following Schoenberg's guidance, Webern attempted to write music of greater length during and after their
World War I
service, relying on the structural support of texts in many
Lieder
.

He rose as a choirmaster and conductor, championing
Gustav Mahler
's music in
Red Vienna
and abroad. With Schoenberg based in Berlin, Webern began writing music of increasing confidence, independence, and scale using twelve-tone technique.
Marginalized
as a "
cultural Bolshevist
" in
Fascist Austria
and
Nazi Germany
, he maintained "
the path to the new music
", enjoyed international recognition, and relied more on teaching
[
b
]
for income. He opposed
fascist
cultural positions but always espoused
pan-Germanism
and was torn, like divided friends and family, among uncertainties. His hope for moderate, stable, and successful governance of
Austria within Nazi Germany
proved misplaced, and he helped Jewish friends emigrate and hide while repeatedly considering emigrating himself.

A soldier accidentally killed Webern after
World War II
. In a phenomenon known as post-Webernism, his music was celebrated by composers, musicians, and scholars.
René Leibowitz
,
Pierre Boulez
,
Robert Craft
, and
Hans and Rosaleen Moldenhauer
established it as an important part of
modernism
through performance, study, and advocacy.
Igor Stravinsky
assimilated it. To many, it represented a path to
serialism
. Broader understanding of Webern's expressive agenda,
performance practice
, and complex
sociocultural
and political context lagged. An
historical edition
of his music is underway.

Webern, of the
minor noble family
[
de
]
, was born 3 December 1883 in Vienna,
Austria-Hungary
, the only surviving son of Carl von Webern, a decorated army veteran, high-ranking
civil servant
, and
mining engineer
who owned the
Lamprechtsberg
copper mine. He grew up mainly in
Graz
(1890–1894) and
Klagenfurt
(1894–1902), with one stay in
Olomouc
and more in Vienna for his father's work. He excelled only in the
humanities
and likely sang in
choir
at school.
[
18
]

He began piano and sang opera with his mother Amalie (née Geer), a trained pianist and accomplished singer, danced with his sisters Rosa and Maria, and received drums, then a trumpet, and later a violin as
Christmas gifts
.
[
19
]
Local musician
Edwin Komauer
also taught him piano, cello, and likely
counterpoint
from Bach's music and
cello suites
.
[
20
]
The family played
chamber music
, including
Mozart
,
Schubert
, and
Beethoven
, and Webern played in local orchestras.
[
21
]

The children spent
Easter
holidays (
Osterferien
[
de
]
) and
summer vacations
(
Sommerfrischen
[
de
]
) at the Preglhof, the
extended family
's country
estate
near
Schwabegg
in
Carinthia
. They played in forests under the
Koralpe
and on a high meadow by the
parish church
, where cattle grazed
pasture
under the care of
herders
. Webern
drove horses
to a
fair
in
Bleiburg
, fought a wildfire, and saved Rosa from drowning in the bathing pond. In winter, they
ice-skated
the
Lendkanal
[
de
]
to the
Wörthersee
. These experiences, and reading
Peter Rosegger
, an Austrian contributor to the broader
Heimatkunst
[
de
]
(
lit.
'
homeland art
'
) movement, shaped his distinct and lasting sense of
Heimat
(
lit.
'
homeland
'
).
[
22
]

Before studying at the
University of Vienna
(1902–1906), Webern immersed himself in concerts, operas, plays, galleries, and cultural history, visiting the
Bayreuth Festival
,
Musikverein
,
Neue Pinakothek
,
Prinzregententheater
, and
Wahnfried
. He took counterpoint with
Karel Navrátil
, harmony with
Hermann Graedener
, cello with
Josef Háša
[
cs
]
, and piano, in which he was less proficient, with an unidentified
Theodor Leschetizky
pupil.
[
23
]

While enrolled, he kept attending many performances to learn the
standard
and emerging repertoire at the
Burgtheater
,
Vienna Court Opera
, and other venues, listening to many works by Brahms, Mahler, Schumann, Strauss, Wagner, and Wolf. He encountered singers like
Theodor Bertram
,
Marie Gutheil-Schoder
, and
Hermann Winkelmann
and conductors like Mahler, Strauss,
Arthur Nikisch
, and
Felix Weingartner
. He sang under
Siegfried Wagner
in
Bruckner's Te Deum
as a
Wagner Society
member and visited the
Munich Kammerspiele
for
Frank Wedekind
's
Hidalla
.
[
24
]

At school, he analyzed
Beethoven's late quartets
at the piano with classmate
Egon Wellesz
, took a Wagner seminar, and learned the historical development of musical styles and techniques mainly from
Guido Adler
, an acquaintance of
Wagner
and
Liszt
,
[
c
]
pupil of
Bruckner
,
[
d
]
and friend of
Mahler
.
[
25
]
For his
musicology
doctorate under Adler, he edited the
Choralis Constantinus
II
.
[
e
]
As a composer, he would emulate its "subtle organization in the
interplay of parts
", which he described at length:

He also studied
art history
and
philosophy
with
Max Dvořák
,
Laurenz Müllner
[
de
]
, and
Franz Wickhoff
,
[
28
]
and joined the
Albrecht Dürer Gesellschaft
(
lit.
'
Albrecht Dürer
Society
'
) in 1903, later serving on its board.
[
29
]
His cousin
Ernst Diez
[
de
]
, then a
University of Graz
art history student,
[
30
]
may have introduced him to the work of
Arnold Böcklin
and
Giovanni Segantini
, which he admired along with that of
Ferdinand Hodler
and
Moritz von Schwind
.
[
31
]
He prized Segantini's
landscapes
as highly as Beethoven's music,
diarying
in 1904:

Finally, Webern studied
Catholic liturgy
and
nationalism
, shaped by his upbringing.
[
33
]
He first found those in his new milieu smug, alien, and distinctly Jewish amid
antisemitic
reaction to the
December Constitution
's 1867
Jewish emancipation
. By 1902, he had close Jewish friends like fellow student
Heinrich Jalowetz
, likely altering his views.
[
34
]

Adler pupil
Karl Weigl
brought Schoenberg's
Pelleas und Melisande
to class in 1903, riveting Webern, who attended performances of his songs and
Verklärte Nacht
in 1903–04.
[
35
]
In 1904, Webern tried
Hans Pfitzner
's composition lessons in Berlin but left over attacks on Mahler and R. Strauss.
[
36
]
Adler admired and may have recommended Schoenberg,
[
37
]
or Webern may have seen his
Schwarzwald School
newspaper ads before starting lessons in fall 1904, perhaps as his first Vienna pupil.
[
35
]

Thus Webern met Berg as another Schoenberg pupil, and Schoenberg's brother-in-law
Alexander Zemlinsky
, through whom he may have worked as an assistant coach at the
Volksoper
in Vienna (1906–1909).
[
38
]
Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern became lifelong friends following similar musical paths.
[
39
]
Adler, Jalowetz, and Webern played Schoenberg's quartets under the composer, accompanying Gutheil-Schoder in rehearsals for
Op. 10
.
[
40
]

Also through Schoenberg, who painted and had a 1910 solo exhibition at
Hugo Heller
[
de
]
's bookstore, Webern met
Gustav Klimt
,
Oskar Kokoschka
,
Max Oppenheimer
(with whom he corresponded on
ich–Du
terms),
Egon Schiele
, and
Emil Stumpp
.
[
41
]
In 1920, Webern wrote Berg about the "indescribable impression" Klimt's work made on him, "that of a luminous, tender, heavenly realm".
[
42
]
[
f
]
He also met
Karl Kraus
, whose
lyrics
he later set, but only to completion in Op. 13/i.
[
44
]

Webern married Wilhelmine "Minna" Mörtl in a 1911
civil ceremony
in Danzig. She had become pregnant in 1910 and feared disapproval, as they were
cousins
. Thus the
Catholic Church
only solemnized their lasting union in 1915, after three children.
[
45
]

They met in 1902,
[
46
]
later
hiking
along the
Kamp
from
Rosenburg-Mold
to
Allentsteig
in 1905. He wooed her with
John Ruskin
essays (in German translation), dedicating his
Langsamer Satz
to her. Webern diaried about their time together "with obvious literary aspirations":

Webern conducted and coached singers and choirs mostly in
operetta
,
musical theater
,
light music
, and some
opera
in his early career. Operetta was in its Viennese
Silver Age
.
[
48
]
Much of it was regarded as "
low-
"
[
49
]
or "
middlebrow
"; Kraus,
Theodor Adorno
, and
Ernst Krenek
found it "uppity" in its pretensions.
[
50
]
[
h
]
In 1924
Ernst Décsey
recalled he once found operetta, with its "old laziness and unbearable musical blandness", beneath him.
[
52
]
J. P. Hodin
contextualized the opposition of the "youthful
intelligentsia
" to operetta with a quote from
Hermann Bahr
's 1907 essay
Wien
:
[
53
]

"What benefit ... if all operettas ... were destroyed", Webern told Diez in 1908.
[
54
]
But by 1912, he told Berg that Zeller's
Vogelhändler
was "quite nice" and Schoenberg that J. Strauss II's
Nacht in Venedig
was "such fine, delicate music. I now believe ... Strauss is a master."
[
55
]
A summer 1908 engagement with
Bad Ischl
's
Kurorchester
[
de
]
was "
hell
".
[
54
]
Webern walked out on an engagement in
Innsbruck
(1909), writing in distress to Schoenberg:

Webern wrote Zemlinsky seeking work at the Berlin or Vienna Volksoper instead.
[
58
]
[
j
]
He started at
Bad Teplitz
's Civic Theater in early 1910, where the local news reported his "sensitive, devoted guidance" as conductor of Fall's
Geschiedene Frau
, but he quit within months due to disagreements.
[
60
]
His repertoire likely included Fall's
Dollarprinzessin
, Lehár's
Graf von Luxemburg
, O. Straus's
Walzertraum
, J. Strauss II's
Fledermaus
, and Schumann's
Manfred
.
[
61
]
There were only 22 musicians in the orchestra, too few to perform
Puccini
's operas, he noted.
[
61
]

Webern then summered at the Preglhof, composing his Op. 7 and planning an opera.
[
62
]
In September, he attended the
Munich
premiere of Mahler's
Symphony of a Thousand
and visited with his idol,
[
k
]
who gave Webern a sketch of "
Lob der Kritik
".
[
l
]
Webern then worked with Jalowetz as assistant conductor in
Danzig
(1910–1911), where he first saw the "almost frightening" ocean.
[
65
]
He conducted
von Flotow
's
Wintermärchen
, George's
Försterchristl
, Jones'
Geisha
, Lehár's
Lustige Witwe
, Lortzing's
Waffenschmied
, Offenbach's
Belle Hélène
, and J. Strauss II's
Zigeunerbaron
.
[
66
]
He particularly enjoyed Offenbach's
Contes d'Hoffmann
and Rossini's
Barbiere di Siviglia
, but only Jalowetz was allowed to conduct this more established repertoire.
[
67
]

Webern soon expressed homesickness to Berg; he could not bear the separation from Schoenberg and their world in Vienna.
[
68
]
He returned after resigning in spring 1911, and the three were
pallbearers
at Mahler's funeral in May 1911.
[
69
]
Then in summer 1911, a neighbor's antisemitic abuse and aggression caused Schoenberg to quit work, abandon Vienna, and go with his family to stay with Zemlinsky on the
Starnbergersee
.
[
70
]
Webern and others fundraised for Schoenberg's return, circulating more than one hundred leaflets with forty-eight signatories, including G. Adler, H. Bahr, Klimt, Kraus, and R. Strauss, among others.
[
71
]
[
m
]
But Schoenberg was resolved to move to Berlin, and not for the first or last time, convinced of Vienna's fundamental hostility.
[
73
]

Webern soon joined him (1910–1912), finishing no new music in his devoted work on Schoenberg's behalf, which entailed many editing and writing projects.
[
74
]
He gradually became tired, unhappy, and homesick.
[
74
]
He tried to persuade Schoenberg to return home to Vienna, continuing the fundraising campaign and lobbying for a position there for Schoenberg, but Schoenberg could not bear to return to the
Akademie für Musik und darstellende Kunst
due to his prior experiences in Vienna.
[
75
]
At the same time, Webern began a cycle of repeatedly quitting and being rehired by Zemlinsky at the
Deutsches Landestheater Prague
(1911–1918).
[
76
]

He had a short-lived conducting post in
Stettin
(1912–1913), which, as all the others, kept him from composing and alienated him.
[
77
]
On the verge of a
breakdown
, he wrote Berg shortly after arriving (Jul. 1912):
[
78
]

Webern's father sold the Preglhof in 1912, and Webern mourned it as a "lost
paradise
".
[
79
]
He revisited it and the family grave in nearby Schwabegg his entire life, associating these places with the memory of his mother, whose 1906 loss profoundly affected him.
[
80
]
In July 1912, he confided in Schoenberg:

Shortly after the anniversary of his mother's death, he wrote Schoenberg in September 1912:
[
81
]

For
Christmas
in 1912, Webern gifted Schoenberg Rosegger's
Waldheimat
[
de
]
(
Forest Homeland
[
82
]
), from which
Julian Johnson
highlighted:

Rosegger's account of his mother's death at the book's end ("An meine Mutter") resonated with Webern, who connected it to his Op. 6 orchestral pieces.
[
84
]
In a January 1913 letter to Schoenberg, Webern revealed that these pieces were a kind of
program music
, each reflecting details and emotions tied to his mother's death.
[
84
]
He had written Berg in July 1912, "my compositions ... relate to the death of my mother", specifying in addition the "Passacaglia, [String] Quartet, most [early] songs, ... second Quartet, ... second [orchestral pieces, Op. 10] (with some exceptions)".
[
85
]
[
n
]

Johnson contended that Webern understood his cultural origins with a maternal view of nature and
Heimat
, which became central themes in his music and thought.
[
87
]
He noted that Webern's deeply personal idea of a maternal homeland—built from memories of pilgrimages to his mother's grave, the "mild", "lost paradise" of home, and the "warmth" of her memory—reflected his sense of loss and his yearning for return.
[
88
]
Drawing loosely on
V. Kofi Agawu
's semiotic approach to classical music, specifically his idea of
musical topics
, Johnson held that all of Webern's music, though rarely directly
representational
, was enriched by its associative references and more specific musical and extra-musical meanings.
[
89
]
In this he claimed to echo Craft, Jalowetz, Krenek, the Moldenhauers, and Webern himself.
[
90
]

In particular, Webern associated nature with his personal (often youthful and spiritual) experiences, forming a topical nexus that recurred in his diaries, letters, and music, sometimes explicitly in sketches and set texts. He frequented the surrounding mountains, summering in
resort towns
like
Mürzzuschlag
and
backpacking
(sometimes
summiting
) the
Gaisstein
,
Grossglockner
,
Hochschober
,
Hochschwab
, and
Schneealpe
(among others) throughout his life. The
alpine climate
and
föhn
, glaciers,
pine trees
, and
springs
"crystal clear down to the bottom" fascinated him. He treasured this time "up there, in the heights", where "one should stay".
[
91
]

He collected and organized "mysterious" alpine herbs and cemetery flowers in
pressed
albums, and he tended gardens at his father's home in Klagenfurt and later at his own homes in the
Mödling District
(first in
Mödling
, then in
Maria Enzersdorf
).
[
92
]
Karl Amadeus Hartmann
remembered that Webern gardened "as a devotion" to Goethe's
Metamorphosis of Plants
, and Johnson drew a parallel between Webern's gardening and composing, emphasizing his connection to nature and his structured, methodical approach in both pursuits.
[
93
]
Johnson noted that gardens and cemeteries are alike in being cultivated, closed spaces of rebirth and quiet reflection.
[
94
]

These habits and preoccupations endured in Webern's life and
œuvre
.
[
87
]
In 1933, Joseph Hueber recalled Webern stopped in a fragrant
meadow
, dug his hands into the soil, and breathed in the flowers and grass before rising to ask: "Do you sense 'Him' ... as strongly as I, 'Him,
Pan
'?"
[
95
]
In 1934, Webern's
lyricist
and collaborator
Hildegard Jone
described his work as "filled ... with the endless love and delicacy of the memory of ... childhood". Webern told her, "through my work, all that is past becomes like a childhood".
[
96
]

In 1912–1913, Webern had a breakdown and saw
Alfred Adler
, who noted his idealism and perfectionism.
[
97
]
There were many factors involved.
[
98
]
Webern had little time (mostly summers) to compose.
[
99
]
There were conflicts at work (e.g., he emphasized that a director called him a
"little man"
).
[
100
]
His ambivalence toward sales-oriented popular music theater contributed ("I ... stir the sauce", he wrote).
[
100
]
"It appears ... improbable that I should remain with the theatre. It is ... terrible. ... I can hardly ... adjust to being away from home", he had written Schoenberg in 1910.
[
101
]
Miserably ill and alienated, he first had sought medical advice and taken rest at a
sanatorium
in
Semmering
[
de
]
.
[
102
]
Adler later evaluated his symptoms as
psychogenic
responses to unmet expectations.
[
97
]
Webern wrote Schoenberg that Adler's
psychoanalysis
was helpful and insightful.
[
97
]

As
World War I
broke out and nationalist fervor swept Europe, Webern found it "inconceivable", he wrote Schoenberg in August 1914, "that the German Reich, and we along with it, should perish."
[
103
]
Yielding in his distrust of
Protestant
Germany, he compared Catholic France to "cannibals" and expressed pan-German patriotism amid wartime propaganda.
[
104
]
He cited his "faith in the German spirit" as having "created, almost exclusively, the culture of mankind".
[
105
]
Despite his high regard of French classical music, especially Debussy's, Webern revered the tradition as centered on counterpoint and form, and as mainly German since Bach.
[
106
]

Webern served intermittently for nearly two years.
[
107
]
The war cost him professional opportunities, much of his social life, and the necessary leisure time to compose (he completed only nine
Lieder
).
[
107
]
Moving frequently and tiring,
[
108
]
he began to despair, explaining to Schoenberg in November 1916 that the reality of war was "
Old Testament
" and "'
Eye for eye
'", "as if
Christ
had never existed".
[
109
]
Webern was discharged in December 1916 for myopia, which had disqualified him from frontline service.
[
110
]

His 1917
Lieder
show that he reflected on his patriotism and processed his sorrow.
[
111
]
He treated the loss of life and, with the 1916 death of
Franz Joseph I of Austria
, the end of an era.
[
112
]
In "Fahr hin, o Seel'", he selected a lament sung at a funeral in a Rosegger novel.
[
112
]
In "Wiese im Park", he selected a text from Kraus recognizing that the day was "dead",
"und alles ... so alt"
[
112
]
("and everything ... so old"). Webern also set several disturbing poems of
Georg Trakl
, not all of which he could finish.
[
113
]
With uninterrupted contrapuntal density, by turns muscular and murmured, he
word painted
Trakl's "great cities" and "dying peoples", "leafless trees", "violent alarm", and "falling stars" in "Abendland III".
[
111
]

During and after the end of the war, Webern, like other Austrians, contended with food shortages, insufficient heating, socioeconomic volatility, and geopolitical disaster in defeat.
[
114
]
He had considered retreating to the countryside and purchasing a farm since 1917, specifically as an asset better than
war bonds
at shielding his family's wealth from inflation.
[
115
]
(In the end, he lost all that remained of his family's wealth to
hyperinflation
by 1924.)
[
114
]
He proposed to Schoenberg that they might be
smallholders
together.
[
115
]

Despite Schoenberg's and his father's advice that he not quit conducting, Webern followed to Schoenberg to Mödling in early 1918, hoping to be reunited with his mentor and to compose more.
[
116
]
But Webern's finances were so poor that he soon explored a "voluntary exile" to Prague again.
[
115
]
Nonetheless, he continued to raise funds, including his own, for Schoenberg,
[
115
]
with whom he spent every day.
[
117
]

Yet soon after he arrived, Webern broke his friendship with Schoenberg.
[
118
]
[
o
]
The break was multifactorial
[
122
]
but involved Webern's dissatisfaction with his career
[
123
]
and financial turmoil.
[
124
]
Berg learned of the Weberns' ill temperaments and "latent antisemitism" from Schoenberg,
[
125
]
[
p
]
and noted that Schoenberg "wouldn't explain" further than "'Webern wants to go to Prague again'".
[
117
]
Bailey Puffett argued that Webern's actions in and after the 1930s suggested that he was not antisemitic, at least in his maturity.
[
130
]
She noted that Webern later wrote Schoenberg that he felt "a sense of the most vehement aversion" against German-speaking people who were.
[
131
]

After meeting with Webern, Berg saw "the matter in a different light", considering Webern "by and large innocent" in light of what Webern said was Schoenberg's "kick in the teeth": after laying plans for a New Music society, Schoenberg angrily called Webern "secretive and deceitful" upon learning that Webern was instead considering Prague again.
[
132
]
They reconciled in October 1918, not long before Webern's father died in 1919.
[
133
]
Webern was changed by these events; he slowly began to grow more independent of Schoenberg, who was like a father to him.
[
134
]
For his part, Schoenberg was not infrequently dubious of Webern, who he still considered his closest friend.
[
135
]
[
q
]

Webern stayed in Vienna and worked with Berg, Schoenberg, and
Erwin Stein
at the
Society for Private Musical Performances
(1918–1921), promoting
new music
through performances and contests. Music included that of
Bartók
, Berg,
Busoni
,
Debussy
,
[
r
]
Korngold
, Mahler,
Novák
,
Ravel
,
Reger
,
Satie
, Strauss,
Stravinsky
, and Webern himself. Webern wrote Berg about Stravinsky's "indescribably touching"
Berceuses du chat
and "glorious"
Pribaoutki
, which Schoenberg conducted at a sold-out 1919 Society concert.
[
137
]
There was perhaps some shared influence among Schoenberg, Stravinsky, and Webern at this time.
[

The Society dissolved amid hyperinflation in 1921, having boasted some 320 members and sponsored more than a hundred concerts.

Webern obtained work as
music director
of the
Wiener Schubertbund
1921, having made an excellent impression as the vocal coach Schoenberg recommended for their 1920 performance of
Gurre-Lieder
.
[
139

They nearly abandoned this project before Webern stepped in.
[
139
]
He led them in performances of Brahms, Mahler, Reger, and Schumann, among others.
[
139
]
But low salary, mandatory touring, and challenges to Webern's thorough rehearsals prompted him to resign in 1922.
[
139
]
He was also chorusmaster of the Mödling
Männergesangverein
[
s
]
(1922–1926) until he resigned in controversy over hiring a Jewish soprano, Greta Wilheim, as a stand-in soloist for Schubert's
Mirjams Siegesgesang
.
[

From 1922, Webern led the mixed-voice amateur
Singverein der Sozialdemokratischen Kunstelle
[

and
Arbeiter-Sinfonie-Konzerte

through
David Josef Bach
, Director of the

Webern won DJ Bach's confidence with a 1922 performance of Mahler's
Symphony No. 3
that established his reputation, prompting Berg to praise him as "the greatest conductor since Mahler himself".
[

[

Webern's Mahler interpretations continued to be widely celebrated.
[

From 1927,
RAVAG
aired twenty-two of Webern's performances.
[

He premiered Berg's
Chamber Concerto
with soloists
Rudolf Kolisch
and
Eduard Steuermann
in 1927
[

and led Stravinsky's
Les Noces
with
Erich Leinsdorf
among the pianists in 1933.

Armand Machabey
noted Webern's regional reputation as a conductor of
"haute valeur"
[
z
]
for his meticulous approach to then contemporary music, comparing him to
Willem Mengelberg
in
Le Ménestrel
(1930).
[
160
]
Some on the left, notably
Oscar Pollak
[
de
]
in
Der Kampf
(1929), criticized Webern's programming as more ambitious and
bourgeois
than popular and
proletarian
.
[
161
]
Webern seemed uneasy in his dependence on the Social Democrats for conducting work, perhaps on religious grounds, Krenek speculated.
[
162
]
But "[a]rtistic work for and with workers was [from] a ... Christian standpoint which Webern took very seriously",
Walter Kolneder
wrote.
[
163
]

Webern's finances were often precarious, even in his years of relative success. Relief came from family, friends, patrons, and prizes.
[
164

He twice received the
Preis der Stadt Wien für Musik
[
de

.
[
aa

To compose more, he sought income while trying not to overcommit himself as a conductor.
[
168
]
He contracted with
Universal Edition
only after 1919, reaching better terms in 1927,
[
169
]
and he was not very ambitious or astute in business.
[
170
]
Even with a doctorate and Guido Adler's respect, he never secured a remunerative university position, whereas in 1925 Schoenberg was invited to the
Prussian Academy of Arts
, ending their seven years together in Mödling.

Social unrest
escalated to the
July Revolt of 1927
and beyond.
[

Webern's nostalgia for
social order
intensified with increasing
civil disorder

In 1928 friends fundraised for him, partly to fund a
rest cure
at the
Kurhaus Semmering
for his exhaustion and (possibly
psychosomatic

In 1928, Berg celebrated the "lasting works" and successes of composers "whose point of departure was ... late Mahler, Reger, and Debussy and whose temporary end point is in ... Schoenberg" in their rise from "pitiful 'cliques'" to a large, diverse, international, and "irresistible movement".
[
176
]
But they were soon
marginalized
and
ostracized
in Central Europe with few exceptions,
[
177
]
[
af
]
and in 1929 Webern wrote Schoenberg that "it is getting worse and worse here".
[
179
]
He declined a RAVAG executive role, citing time constraints and fearing further affiliation with the Social Democrats.
[
180
]
[
ag
]

Webern's music was performed and publicized more widely starting in the latter half of the 1920s.
[
182
]
Yet he found no great success as Berg enjoyed with
Wozzeck
[
183
]
nor as Schoenberg did, to a lesser extent, with
Pierrot lunaire
or in time with
Verklärte Nacht
. His
Symphony, Op. 21
, was performed as a chamber piece in New York by the
League of Composers
(1929) and separately in London at the
1931 International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM) Festival
.
Louis Krasner
sensed some resentment, noting that Webern had "very little".
[
184
]
Krenek's impression was that Webern resented his financial hardships and lack of wider recognition.
[
162
]

Financial crises
, complex
social
and
political movements
, pervasive antisemitism,
culture wars
, and renewed military conflicts
[
ah
]
continued to shape Webern's world, profoundly circumscribing his life.
[
185
]
Shortly after Webern conducted the Brecht–Eisler
Solidaritätslied
in 1933,
Engelbert Dollfuss
saw the
Kriegswirtschaftliches Ermächtigungsgesetz
[
de
]
passed, and choir singers' homes were raided.
[
186
]
In the 1934
Austrian Civil War
, Austrofascists
[
ai
]
executed, exiled, and imprisoned Social Democrats, outlawed their party, and abolished cultural institutions.
[
188
]

Stigmatized by his decade-long association with Social Democrats, Webern lost a promising domestic conducting career, which might have been better recorded.
[
189
]
He eventually abandoned efforts with what remained of the workers' choir in the form of the much constrained
Freie Typographia
in 1935,
[
190
]
instead working as a UE editor and
IGNM-Sektion Österreich
[
de
]
board member and president (1933–1938, 1945).
[
191
]

By the late 1920s, antisemitism had become epidemic, and the socioculturally mixed milieu of Vienna's modern arts and entertainment, including the music of Webern, Schoenberg, Berg, and Mahler, was mocked as foreign and Jewish in a
racialized
sense, contrasting with what was touted as truly German (and typically conservative, traditional, or rural).
[
192
]
[
aj
]
Webern's admission to the Prussian Academy of Arts was withdrawn as
Adolf Hitler
rose in Germany,
[
186
]
and an Austrian
Gauleiter
labeled Berg and Webern "Jewish" on
Bayerischer Rundfunk
in 1933.
[

ak

In the late 1930s, theirs was exhibited as
"
Entartete Musik

in Nazi Germany
[
199

and later at the
Vienna Künstlerhaus
in
Nazi Austria
.
[

Webern delivered an eight-
lecture
series
Der Weg zur Neuen Musik
[
am
]
at
Rita Kurzmann-Leuchter
[
de
]
's and her physician husband Rudolf Kurzman's home (Feb.–Apr. 1933).
[
203
]
He attacked fascist
cultural policy
, asking "What will come of our struggle?" He observed that "'
cultural Bolshevism
' is the name given to everything that is going on around Schoenberg, Berg, and myself (Krenek too)"
[
an
]
and warned, "Imagine what will be destroyed, wiped out, by this hate of culture!"
[
205
]
He lectured more at the Kurzmann-Leuchter home, privately in 1934–1935 on
Beethoven's piano sonatas
to about 40 attendees and later in 1937–1938.
[
206
]

Persevering, Webern wrote Krenek that "art has its own laws ... if one wants to achieve something in it, only these laws and nothing else can have validity";
[
ao
]
upon completing Op. 26 (1935), he wrote DJ Bach, "I hope it is so good that (if people ever get to know it) they will declare me ready for a
concentration camp
or an
insane asylum
!"
[
208
]
The Vienna Philharmonic nearly refused to play Berg's
Violin Concerto
in 1936.
[
ap
]
Peter Stadlen
's 1937 Op. 27 premieres were the last Viennese Webern performances until after World War II.
[
210
]
The critical success of
Hermann Scherchen
's 1938 ISCM London Op. 26 premiere encouraged Webern to write more cantatas and reassured him after a cellist quit Op. 20 mid-performance, declaring it unplayable.
[
211
]

Webern's milieu comprised increasingly vast differences.
[
212
]
Like most Austrians, he and his family were
Catholic
, though not church regulars; Webern was perhaps devout if unorthodox.
[
213
]
They became politically divided.
[
aq
]
His friends (e.g., then
Zionist
Schoenberg,
[
ar
]
left-leaning
Berg
[
as
]
) were of a mostly Jewish milieu from
late Imperial
to "
red
" (Social Democratic) Vienna.
[
221
]
Alma Mahler
, Krenek,
Willi Reich
[
de
]
, and Stein preferred or supported the "
lesser evil
"
[
at
]
of the
Austrofascists
(or aligned
Italian fascists
)
vis-à-vis
the Nazis.
[
223
]
Presuming power would moderate Hitler, Webern mediated among friends with an optimistic or self-soothing complacency, exasperating those who were at risk.
[
224
]

Webern found himself surrounded mostly by one side as Schoenberg
immigrated
to the US (1933),
Rudolf Ploderer
died by suicide (1933),
[
au
]
Berg died (1935), and DJ Bach, among others (e.g., Greissle, Jalowetz, Krenek, Reich, Steuermann, Wellesz), fled or worse.
[
226
]
Webern immediately considered following Schoenberg to the US, which Schoenberg discouraged despite seeking opportunities there for Webern.
[
227
]
Schoenberg knew that Webern was deeply attached to home, and he told Webern that conditions in the US were poor, mentioning the ongoing
Great Depression
.
[
228
]

Webern's views of
National Socialism
have been variously described.
[
av
]
His published items
[
aw
]
reflected his audience or context.
[
231
]
Secondary literature reflected limited evidence or ideological orientations
[
ax
]
and admitted uncertainty.
[
233
]
Julie Brown noted hesitancy to approach the topic and echoed the Moldenhauers, considering the issue "vexed" and Webern a "political enigma".
[
234
]
Bailey Puffett considered Webern's politics "somewhat vague" and his situation "complex", noting that he seemed to avoid definitive political association as a practical strategy.
[
235
]
Webern's apparent sympathies with some of the Nazis' program later became a sensation in his reception, but the matter was often oversimplified or decontextualized and rested on limited evidence (mostly letters), Johnson wrote, sometimes with the larger aim of politicizing Webern's music and his musical language.
[
236
]

Krasner and the Moldenhauers surmised Webern's
cognitive dissonance
, finding him "idealistic and rather naive".
[
237
]
In 1943 Kurt List described Webern as "utterly ignorant" and "perpetual[ly] confus[ed]" about politics, "a ready prey to the personal influence of family and friends".
[
ay
]
Johnson described him as "personally shy, a man of private feeling and essentially
apolitical
",
[
240
]
and as "prone to
identify
with Nazi politics as ... other ... Austrians".
[
241
]
Webern may have believed that the Nazis shared his own ideals, Johnson wrote, explaining that "it is possible that ... naiveté, ... ignorance and ... adherence to his own beliefs allowed Webern to see in Nazi ideology only ... elements ... he wanted to find".
[
242
]

Webern conducted nine concerts as a
BBC Symphony
visiting conductor (1929–1936). A
talkie
on his first London visit inspired him to ask Steuermann about writing
film music
, and Steuermann wrote his relatives in the film industry,
Salka Viertel
and
Berthold Viertel
, for their suggestions.
[
243
]
For the BBC, Webern selected then little-known Mahler (including both
nocturnes
from the
Symphony No. 7
in 1934).
[
244
]
He insisted on rehearsing at the piano with vocalists and was criticized for coaching
musical phrasing
.
[
244
]

In
Barcelona
, he withdrew from the
1936 world premiere
of Berg's Violin Concerto, grief-stricken after Berg's death and overwhelmed by difficulties.
[
245
]
There Krasner recalled,

The two then played the concerto in London with BBC musicians, who rehearsed before Webern conducted.
Kenneth Anthony Wright
noted Webern's "funny little explanations of the varying dynamics and flexibility of tempo", but "every syllable and every gesture of Webern was understood and lovingly heeded", Krasner recalled. The musicians "all admired and respected Webern", according to
Sidonie Goossens
. But
Felix Aprahamian
,
Benjamin Britten
, and
Berthold Goldschmidt
criticized Webern's conducting, and BBC management did not invite him back after 1936.
[
245
]
[
az
]

Krasner's last visit with Webern was interrupted by
Kurt Schuschnigg
's broadcast speech that the
Anschluss
was imminent.
[
246
]
Krasner had been playing some of Schoenberg's
Violin Concerto
for Webern and trying to convince him to write a sonata for solo violin.
[
247
]
When Webern turned on the radio and heard this speech, he urged Krasner to flee.
[
248
]
Because Webern's family included Nazis, Krasner wondered whether Webern had already known that the Anschluss was planned for that day.
[
249
]
He also wondered whether Webern's warning had been solely for his safety or whether it had also been to save Webern the embarrassment of the violinist's presence in the event of celebration at the Webern home.
[
250
]

Much of Austria did celebrate.
[
251
]
But Webern made only a terse note of the Anschluss in his notebook without registering any clear emotion.
[
252
]
In fact, he wrote Jone and her husband
Josef Humplik
asking not to be disturbed as he was "totally immersed" in work on Op. 28.
[
253
]
Thus, Bailey Puffett suggested that Webern may have received Krasner's visit as a distraction.
[
254
]

By now,
Hartmut Krones
wrote, Webern likely realized his error in anticipating the Nazis' self-moderation.
[
186
]
Bailey Puffett proposed that Krasner, with the benefit of hindsight from the perspective of his 1987 account, may have resented Webern for "refusing to see the reality of Hitler's antisemitism", at least until after 1936.
[
254
]
That year, Webern had insisted that Krasner and he travel through Nazi Germany to stop at a
Munich
train station café, where Krasner said "anything untoward was the least likely to happen", in an attempt to demonstrate the lack of danger.
[
255
]

Support for the Anschluss rested on antisemitism, economic prospects,
[
ba
]
and the idea of a
Greater Germany
.
[
257
]
[
bb
]
Under some duress,
Theodor Innitzer
ushered in Catholic support.
[
267
]
The
Austrian Nazis
and Social Democrats, both outlawed, were linked in opposition to the Austrofascists.
[
268
]
Karl Renner
supported unification as a matter of
self-determination
before the years (1933–1938) of
Gleichschaltung
and Nazi
soft power
,
[
bc
]
and he and others now supported (or accepted as inevitable) the 1938 Anschluss.
[
270
]
Otto Bauer
, in exile, expressed some acceptance with profound resignation and misgivings, having worked toward Austria's German incorporation since
Provisional National Assembly
's 1918 vote.
[
271
]
Webern had long shared in common pan-German sentiments, especially during wartime.
[
272
]
He also likely hoped to conduct again, securing a firmer future for his family under a new regime proclaiming itself "
socialist
" no less than
nationalist
.
[
273
]
According to what Josef Polnauer, a fellow early Schoenberg pupil, historian, and librarian, told the Moldenhauers, Webern's optimism was not dispelled until 1941.
[
274
]

Krasner emphasized Webern's "naiveté" but acknowledged that he himself had been "foolhardy" as to the danger of antisemitism, recalling "read[ing] in the papers ... denials" and "want[ing] to see for myself" in 1938.
[
275
]
[
bd
]
Consensus had emerged on the center, left, and in some mainstream Jewish organizations that antisemitism was only a means to political power since its 1890s definition as the "
socialism of fools
".
[
277
]
The
Frankfurt School
first treated it within the rubric of
class conflict
(Adorno began to consider it otherwise in his 1939 "Fragments on Wagner"),
[
278
]
and
Franz Neumann
briefly contended that the Nazis would "never allow a complete extermination of the Jews" in his 1942
Behemoth
(before revisions in 1944).
[
277
]

Kristallnacht
shocked Webern,
[
279
]
who thought that reports of Nazi atrocities were politicized, unreliable propaganda.
[
280
]
He visited and aided Jewish colleagues DJ Bach,
Otto Jokl
[
de
]
, Polnauer, and Hugo Winter.
[
279
]
For Jokl, a former Berg pupil, Webern wrote a recommendation letter to facilitate emigration. When that failed, Webern served as his
godfather
in a 1939
baptism
.
[
281
]
Polnauer, whose emigration
Mark Brunswick
, Schoenberg, and Webern were unable to secure,
[
282
]
managed to survive
the Holocaust
as an
albino
; he later edited a 1959 UE publication of Webern's correspondence from this time with Humplik and Jone.
[
283
]
Webern moved Humplik's 1929 gift of a Mahler
bust
to his bedroom,
[
284
]
having told
Felix Greissle
[
de
]
in 1936 or 1937 that Mahler's time would come within a German
Kulturnation
[
285
]
and DJ Bach that "not all Germans are Nazis".
[
286
]

With "almost all his friends and old pupils ... gone",
[
287
]
Webern found himself increasingly alone,
[
288
]
and his financial situation was poor. He talked to Polnauer about emigrating but was reluctant to leave home and family.
[
289
]
He entered a period of "
inward emigration
" and focused on composition,
[
290
]
writing to artist Franz Rederer in 1939, "We live completely withdrawn. I work a lot."
[
281
]
He corresponded extensively to maintain relationships, imploring his student
George Robert
to play Schoenberg in New York
[
291
]
and expressing his loneliness and isolation to Schoenberg.
[
292
]
Then war limited postal service,
[
293
]
disrupting their direct correspondence completely by 1941.

Webern's mature music was performed mostly outside the
Reich
, where only his tonal music and arrangements were allowed as works not in the style of a
"
Judenknecht
"
. His arrangement of two of Schubert's
German Dances
was performed in Leipzig and broadcast in the
Reich
and Fascist Italy (1941).
[
294
]
His Passacaglia was considered for a Viennese contemporary music festival in 1942,
Karl Böhm
or
Wilhelm Furtwängler
conducting, but this did not happen.
[
294
]
Hans Rosbaud
likely performed it in
occupied Strasbourg
that year, and
Luigi Dallapiccola
sought to have it performed in Venice in 1943.
[
294
]
Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt
planned Webern's arrangement of the six-voice
ricercar
from Bach's
Musical Offering
at the
Deutsche Oper Berlin
in 1943, but war intervened.
[
294
]

Supported by
IGNM-Sektion Basel
, the
Orchester Musikkollegium Winterthur
, and
Werner Reinhart
, Webern attended three Swiss concerts, his last trips outside the
Reich
.
[
295
]
In 1940,
Erich Schmid
conducted Op. 1 in
Winterthur
; soprano
Marguerite Gradmann-Lüscher
sang Op. 4 and most of Op. 12 (not No. 3) at the
Musik-Akademie der Stadt Basel
, Schmid accompanying. In Feb. 1943, Scherchen gave the world premiere of Op. 30 at the
Winterthur Stadthaus
[
de
]
. Webern intimated to Willi Reich that he might immigrate there, joking (Oct. 1939) "Anything of the sort did seem quite out of the question for me!"
[
296
]
But Webern failed to find employment, even as a formality, likely due to
anti-German sentiment
in the context of
Swiss neutrality
and
refugee laws
.
[
297
]

In the
Reich
, he met with former Society violist
Othmar Steinbauer
about a formal teaching role in Vienna in early 1940, but nothing materialized.
[
298
]
He lectured at the homes of
Erwin Ratz
and
Carl Prohaska
[
de
]
's widow Margaret (1940–1942).
[
299
]
Many private pupils came to him between 1940 and 1943, even from afar, among them briefly Hartmann.
[
300
]
Hartmann, who opposed the Nazis, remembered that Webern counseled him to respect authority, at least publicly, for the sake of order.
[
268
]

Sharing in wartime public sentiment at the height of Hitler's popularity (spring 1940), Webern expressed high hopes, crediting him as "unique" and
"singular"
[
be
]
for "the new state for which the seed was laid twenty years ago". These were patriotic letters to Joseph Hueber, an active soldier,
baritone
, close friend, and
mountaineering
companion who often sent Webern gifts.
[
301
]
Indeed, Hueber had just sent Webern
Mein Kampf
.
[
bf
]

Unaware of
Stefan George
's aversion to the Nazis, Webern reread
Das neue Reich
[
de
]
and marveled suggestively at the wartime leader envisioned therein, but "I am not taking a position!" he wrote active soldier, singer, and onetime Social Democrat, Hans Humpelstetter.
[
303
]
For Johnson, "Webern's own image of a
neue Reich
was never of this world; if his politics were ultimately complicitous it was largely because his
utopian
apoliticism played so easily into ... the
status quo
."
[
304
]

By Aug. 1940, Webern depended financially on his children.
[
305
]
He sought wartime emergency relief funds from
Künstlerhilfe Wien
and the
Reichsmusikkammer
Künstlerdank
[
de
]
(1940–1944), which he received despite indicating non-membership in the Nazi Party on an application.
[
306
]
Whether Webern ever
joined
the party was unknown.
[
307
]
[
bg
]
This represented his only income after 1942.
[
310
]
He nearly exhausted his savings by 1944.
[
310
]

His 1943–1945 letters were strewn with references to bombings, death, destruction, privation, and the disintegration of local order, but several grandchildren were born.
[
311
]
In Dec. 1943, aged 60, he wrote from a
barrack
that he was working 6 am–5 pm as an air-raid protection police officer,
conscripted
into the
war effort
.
[
311
]
He corresponded with Willi Reich about
IGNM-Sektion Basel
's concert marking his sixtieth, in which
Paul Baumgartner
played Op. 27, Walter Kägi  Op. 7, and
August Wenzinger
Op. 11. Gradmann-Lüscher sang both Opp. 3 and the world premiere of 23.
[
312
]
For Schoenberg's 70th birthday (1944), Webern asked Reich to convey "my most heartfelt remembrances, ... longing! ... hopes for a happy future!"
[
313
]
In Feb. 1945, Webern's only son Peter, intermittently conscripted since 1940,
[
314
]
was killed in an air attack; airstrike sirens interrupted the family's mourning at the funeral.
[
315
]

The Weberns assisted Schoenberg's eldest son, Georg, during the war; with the
Red Army
's April 1945 arrival imminent, they gave him their Mödling apartment, the property and childhood home of Webern's son-in-law Benno Mattl.
[
bh
]
Georg later told Krasner that Webern "felt he'd betrayed his best friends."
[
317
]
The Weberns fled west, resorting to traveling partly on foot to
Mittersill
to rejoin their family of "17 persons pressed together in the smallest possible space".
[

On the night of 15 September 1945, Webern was outside smoking when he was shot and killed by a US soldier in an apparent accident.
[
319
]
He had been following Thomas Mann's work, which the Nazis had burned, noting in 1944 that Mann had finished
Joseph and His Brothers
.
[
320
]
In his last notebook entry, Webern quoted
Rainer Maria Rilke
: "Who speaks of victory? To endure is everything."

Webern's wife Minna suffered final years of grief, poverty, and loneliness as friends and family continued emigrating. She wished Webern had lived to see more success.
[
324
]
With the abolition of
Entartete Kunst
policies,
Alfred Schlee
[
de
]
solicited her for hidden manuscripts; thus Opp. 17, 24–25, and 29–31 were published.
[
324
]
She worked to get Webern's 1907 Piano Quintet published via Kurt List.
[
324
]

In 1947 she wrote Diez, now in the US, that by 1945 Webern was "firmly resolved to go to England".
[
324
]
Likewise, in 1946 she wrote DJ Bach in London: "How difficult the last eight years had been for him. ... [H]e had only the one wish: to flee from this country. But one was caught, without a will of one's own. ... It was close to the limit of endurance what we had to suffer."
[
324
]
Minna died in 1949.
[

Webern's music was generally concise,
organic
, and parsimonious,
[
bj
]
with very small
motifs
,
palindromes
, and
parameterization
on both the micro- and macro-scale.
[
332
]
His idiosyncratic approach reflected affinities with Schoenberg, Mahler,
[
bk
]
Guido Adler and
early music
; interest in
esotericism
and
Naturphilosophie
; and thorough perfectionism.
[
bl
]
He engaged with the work of
Goethe
, Bach,
[
bm
]
and the
Franco-Flemish School
in addition to that of Wolf,
Brahms
,
[
bn
]
Wagner, Liszt,
Schumann
, Beethoven, Schubert ("so genuinely Viennese"), and Mozart.
[
347
]
[
bo
]
Stylistic shifts were not neatly coterminous with gradually developed technical devices, particularly in the case of his mid-period
Lieder
.
[
bp
]

His music was also characteristically linear and
song-like
.
[
355
]
Much of it (and Berg's
[
356
]
and Schoenberg's)
[
357
]
was for singing.
[
39
]
[
bq
]
Johnson described the song-like
gestures
of Op. 11/i.
[
360
]
In Webern's mid-period
Lieder
, some heard instrumentalizing of the voice
[
361
]
(often in relation to the clarinet)
[
362
]
representing yet some continuity with
bel canto
.
[
363
]
[
br
]
Lukas Näf described one of Webern's signature hairpins (on the Op. 21/i mm. 8–9
bass clarinet
tenuto
note) as a
messa di voce
requiring some
rubato
to execute faithfully.
[
365
]
[
bs
]
Adventurous
textures
and
timbres
, and melodies of wide leaps and sometimes extreme
ranges
and registers were typical.
[
367
]

For Johnson, Webern's
rubato
compressed Mahler's "'surging and ebbing'" tempi; this and Webern's dynamics indicated a "vestigial lyrical subjectivity."
[
368
]
Webern often set carefully chosen lyric poetry.
[
369
]
He related his music not only to nostalgia for the lost family and home of his youth, but also to his Alpinism and fascination with
plant aromatics
and
morphology
.
[
370
]
He was compared to Mahler in his orchestration and semantic preoccupations (e.g., memory, landscapes, nature, loss, often
Catholic
mysticism
).
[
371
]
In Jone, who he met with her husband Humplik via the
Hagenbund
, Webern found a lyricist who shared his esoteric, natural, and spiritual interests. She provided texts for his late vocal works.
[
372
]

Webern's and Schoenberg's music distinctively prioritized minor seconds, major sevenths, and minor ninths
[
bt
]
as noted in 1934 by
microtonalist
Alois Hába
.
[
373
]
The
Kholopov siblings
noted the
semitone
's unifying role by
axial
inversional symmetry
and
octave
equivalence
as
interval class
1 (ic1), approaching
Allen Forte
's
generalized
pitch-class set analysis
.
[
374
]
Webern's consistent use of ic1 in
cells
and
sets
, often expressed as a wide interval musically,
[
375
]
[
bu
]
was well noted.
[
bv
]
Symmetric
pitch-interval
practices varied in rigor and use by others (e.g., Berg, Schoenberg, Bartók, Debussy, Stravinsky; more nascently Mahler, Brahms, Bruckner,
[
bw
]
Liszt, Wagner). Berg and Webern took symmetric approaches to
elements of music
beyond pitch. Webern later linked pitches and other
parameters
in schemes (e.g.,
fixed or "frozen" register
).
[
380
]

Relatively few of Webern's works were published in his lifetime. Amid fascism and
Emil Hertzka
's passing, this included late as well as early works (in addition to others without opus numbers). His rediscovery prompted many publications, but some early works were unknown until after the work of the Moldenhauers well into the 1980s,
[
381
]
obscuring formative facets of his musical identity.
[
382
]
Thus when Boulez first oversaw a project to record Webern's music, the results fit on three CDs and the second time, six.
[
383
]
[
bx
]
An
historical edition
of his music has remained in progress.

Webern published little
juvenilia
; like Brahms, he was meticulous and self-conscious, revising extensively.
[
385
]
His earliest works were mostly
Lieder
on works of
Richard Dehmel
,
Gustav Falke
, and
Theodor Storm
.
[
386
]
He set seven
Ferdinand Avenarius
poems on the "changing moods" of life and nature (1899–1904).
[
387
]
Schubert, Schumann, and Wolf were important models. With its brief, potent expressivity and utopianization of the natural world, the (
German
)
Romantic
Lied
had a lasting influence on Webern's musical aesthetic.
[
388
]
He never abandoned its lyricism, intimacy, and wistful or nostalgic topics, though his music became more abstract, idealized, and introverted.
[
386
]

Webern memorialized the Preglhof in a diary poem "An der Preglhof" and in the
tone poem
Im Sommerwind
(1904), both after
Bruno Wille
's
idyll
. In Webern's
Sommerwind
, Derrick Puffett found affinities with Strauss's
Alpensinfonie
, Charpentier's
Louise
, and Delius's
Paris
.

At the Preglhof in summer 1905, Webern wrote his tripartite, single-movement string quartet in a highly
modified
sonata
form, likely responding to Schoenberg's
Op. 7
.
[
389
]
He quoted
Jakob Böhme
in the preface
[
390
]
and mentioned the panels
[
by
]
of Segantini's
Trittico della natura
[
bz
]
as "
Werden–Sein–Vergehen
"
[
ca
]
in sketches.
[
391
]
Sebastian Wedler argued that this quartet bore the influence of Richard Strauss's
Also Sprach Zarathustra
in its germinal three-note motive, opening
fugato
of its third (development) section, and
Nietzschean
reading (via
eternal recurrence
) of Segantini's triptych.
[
392
]
In its opening harmonies,
Allen Forte
and
Heinz-Klaus Metzger
noted Webern's anticipation of Schoenberg's
atonality
in
Op. 10
.
[
393
]

In 1906, Schoenberg assigned Webern
Bach chorales
to harmonize and figure; Webern completed eighteen in a highly chromatic idiom.
[
394
]
Then the Passacaglia, Op. 1 (1908) was his graduation piece, and the Op. 2 choral canons soon followed. The passacaglia's chromatic
harmonic
language and less conventional
orchestration
distinguished it from prior works; its form foreshadowed those of his later works.
[
395
]
Conducting the 1911 Danzig premiere of Op. 1 at the Friedrich-Wilhelm-
Schützenhaus
[
de
]
, he paired it with Debussy's 1894
Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune
,
Ludwig Thuille
's 1896
Romantische Ouvertüre
, and Mahler's 1901–1904
Kindertotenlieder
in a poorly attended
Moderner Abend
[
cb
]
concert. The
Danziger Zeitung
[
de
]
critic
derided Op. 1 as an "insane experiment".
[
396
]

In 1908 Webern also began an opera on
Maeterlinck
's
Alladine et Palomides
[
fr
]
, of which only unfinished sketches remained,
[
397
]
and in 1912 he wrote Berg that he had finished one or more scenes for another planned but unrealized opera,
Die sieben Prinzessinnen
, on Maeterlinck's
Les Sept Princesses
[
fr
]
.
[
398
]
He had been an opera enthusiast from his student days.
[
399
]
Debussy's
Pelléas et Mélisande
enraptured him twice in Dec. 1908 Berlin and again in 1911 Vienna.
[
400
]
As a vocal coach and opera conductor, he knew the repertoire "perfectly ... every
cut
, ...
unmarked
cadenza
, and in the
comic operas
every theatrical joke".
[
401
]
He "adored" Mozart's
Il Seraglio
and revered Strauss, predicting
Salome
would last. When in high spirits, Webern would sing bits of Lortzing's
Zar und Zimmermann
, a personal favorite. He expressed interest (to
Max Deutsch
) in writing an opera pending a good text and adequate time; in 1930, he asked Jone for "opera texts, or rather dramatic texts", planning cantatas instead.
[
402
]

Webern's music, like Schoenberg's, was freely atonal after Op. 2. Some of their and Berg's music from this time was published in
Der Blaue Reiter
.
[
404
]
Schoenberg and Webern were so mutually influential, the former later joked, "I haven't the slightest idea who I am".
[
405
]
In Op. 5/iii, Webern borrowed from Schoenberg's Op. 10/ii. In Op. 5/iv, he borrowed from Schoenberg's Op. 10/iv setting of "Ich fühle luft von anderen planeten".
[
406
]
[
cc
]

The first of Webern's innovative and increasingly extremely aphoristic Opp. 5–11 (1909–1914) radically influenced Schoenberg's Opp.
11
/iii
[
cd
]
and
16
–
17
(and Berg's Opp.
4
–
5
).
[
408
]
Here,
Martin Zenck
[
de
]
considered, Webern did not seek "the new ... in [music of] the past but in the future".
[
409
]
In writing the Op. 9
bagatelles
, Webern reflected in 1932, "I had the feeling that when the twelve notes had all been played the piece was over."
[
410
]
"[H]aving freed music from the shackles of tonality," Schoenberg wrote, he and his pupils believed "music could renounce motivic features".
[
411
]
This "intuitive aesthetic" arguably proved to be aspirational insofar as motives persisted in their music.
[
412
]

Two enduring topics emerged in Webern's work: familial (especially maternal) loss and
memory
, often involving some
religious experience
; and abstracted
landscapes
idealized as
spiritual
, even
pantheistic
,
Heimat
(e.g., the Preglhof, the
Eastern Alps
).
[
413
]
Webern explored these ideas explicitly in his
Symbolist
stage play
Tot: Sechs Bilder für die Bühne
(
Dead: Six Scenes for the Stage
, Oct. 1913).
[
414
]
The play comprises six
tableaux vivants
[
ce
]
set in the Alps, over the course of which a mother and father reflect on and come to terms with the loss of their son.
[
416
]
[
cf
]
The script specifies exact lighting, sounds, delivery, and gestures to match mood, time, and place, with birds, bells, and flowers as important elements of a still, holy world.
[
415
]
Webern drew so heavily from Swedenborg's
theological doctrine of correspondences
, quoting from
Vera Christiana Religio
at length, that Schoenberg considered the play unoriginal.
[
419
]

It is known that Webern sublimated these concerns into his music, particularly in the case of his Op. 6.
[
419
]
Confiding in Berg and Schoenberg, Webern told the latter some about the programmatic narrative for that music in Jan. 1913, as Schoenberg prepared to premiere it at what would become the
Skandalkonzert
that March:
[
420
]

As Webern's music took on the character of such static dramaticovisual
scenes
, his pieces frequently culminated in the accumulation and amalgamation (often the
developing variation
) of compositional material.
Fragmented
melodies frequently began and ended on weak
beats
, settled into or emerged from
ostinati
, and were dynamically and texturally faded, mixed, or contrasted.
[
422
]
Tonality became less directional,
functional
, or narrative than tenuous, spatial, or symbolic as fit Webern's topics and literary settings. Stein thought that "his compositions should be understood as musical
visions
".
[
ch
]
Oliver Korte
traced Webern's
Klangfelder
[
ci
]
to Mahler's "suspensions".
[
cj
]

Expanding on
Mahler's orchestration
, Webern linked colorful, novel, fragile, and intimate sounds, often nearly silent at
ppp
, to lyrical topics: solo violin to female voice; closed or open
voicings
, sometimes
sul ponticello
, to dark or light respectively; compressed range to absence, emptiness, or loneliness; registral expansion to fulfillment, (spiritual) presence, or transcendence;
[
ck
]
celesta, harp, and glockenspiel to the celestial or ethereal; and trumpet, harp, and
string harmonics
to angels or heaven.
[
424

[
cl

With elements of
Kabarett
,
[
cm
]
neoclassicism
,
[
cn
]
and ironic Romanticism
[
co
]
in
Pierrot lunaire
, Op. 21 (1912), Schoenberg began
[
cp
]
to distance himself from Webern's and latterly Berg's aphoristic expressionism, which provoked the
Skandalkonzert
. Alma recalled Schoenberg telling her and
Franz Werfel
"how much he was suffering under the dangerous influence of Webern", drawing on "all his strength to extricate himself from it".
[
425
]

During and after
World War I
(1914–1926) Webern worked on some fifty-six songs.
[
428
]
He finished thirty-two, ordered into sets (in ways that do not always align with their chronology) as Opp. 12–19.
[
428
]
Schoenberg's recent vocal music had been motivated by the idea that "absolute purity" in composition couldn't be sustained,
[
429
]
and Webern took Schoenberg's advice to write songs as a means of composing something more substantial than aphorisms, often making earnest settings of folk, lyric, or spiritual texts.
[
430
]
The first of these mid-period
Lieder
was an unfinished setting of a passage ("In einer lichten Rose ...") from Dante's
Paradiso
,
Canto XXXI
.
[
431
]

By comparison to melodic "atomization" in Op. 11,
Walter Kolneder
noted relatively "long arcs" melodic writing in Op. 12
[
432
]
and polyphonic
part writing
to "control the ... expression" in Opp. 12–16 more generally.
[
433
]
"How much I owe to your
Pierrot
", Webern told Schoenberg after setting Trakl's "Abendland III" (Op. 14/iv),
[
434
]
in which, distinctly, there was no silence until a pause at the concluding gesture. The
contrapuntal
procedures and
nonstandard ensemble
of
Pierrot
are both evident in Webern's Opp. 14–16.
[
435
]

Schoenberg "yearn[ed] for a style for large forms ... to give personal things an objective, general form."
[
cr
]
Berg, Webern, and he had indulged their shared interest in
Swedenborgian mysticism
and
Theosophy
since 1906, reading Balzac's
Louis Lambert
and
Séraphîta
and Strindberg's
Till Damaskus
and
Jacob lutte
.
Gabriel
, protagonist of Schoenberg's semi-autobiographical
Die Jakobsleiter
(1914–1922, rev. 1944)
[
cs
]
described a
journey
: "whether right, whether left, forwards or backwards, uphill or down – one must keep on going without asking what lies ahead or behind",
[
ct
]
which Webern interpreted as a
conceptual metaphor
for (twelve-tone)
pitch space
.
[
442
]
Schoenberg later reflected on "how enthusiastic we were about this."
[
cu
]

On the journey to composition with twelve tones, Webern revised many of his mid-period
Lieder
in the years after their apparent composition but before publication, increasingly prioritizing clarity of pitch relations, even against timbral effects, as
Anne C. Shreffler
[
444
]
and Felix Meyer described. His and Schoenberg's music had long been marked by its contrapuntal rigor, formal schemes, systematic pitch organization, and rich motivic design, all of which they found in the music of Brahms before them.
[
445
]
Webern had written music preoccupied with the idea of dodecaphony since at least the
total chromaticism
of his Op. 9 bagatelles (1911).
[
446
]
and Op. 11 cello pieces (1914).
[
447
]
[
cv
]
He began preparing these aphoristic works for publication while composing most of his mid-period
Lieder
, which may have reoriented him to his own lyricism.
[
449
]

There are twelve-tone sets with repeated notes at the start of Op. 12/i and in some bars of Op. 12/iv, in addition to many ten- and eleven-tone sets throughout Op. 12.
[
450
]
Webern wrote to Jalowetz in 1922 about Schoenberg's lectures on "a new type of
motivic work
", one that "unfolds the entire development of, if I may say so,
our
technique (harmony, etc.)".
[
451
]
It was "almost everything that has occupied me for about ten years", Webern continued.
[
452
]
He regarded Schoenberg's
transformation
of twelve-tone rows as the "solution" to their compositional concerns.
[
453
]
In Op. 15/iv (1922), Webern first used a tone row (in the voice's opening twelve notes), charted
the four basic row forms
, and integrated
tri
- and
tetrachords
into the harmonic and melodic texture.
[
454
]
He systematically used
twelve-tone technique
for the first time in Op. 16/iv–v (1924).
[
455
]

With Schoenberg leaving Mödling in 1925 and this compositional approach at his disposal, Webern obtained more artistic autonomy and aspired to write in larger forms, expanding on the extreme concentration of expression and material in his earlier music.
[
458
]
Until the
Kinderstück
for piano (1924, intended as one of a set),
Klavierstück
(1925), and
Satz
for string trio (1925), Webern had finished nothing but
Lieder
since a 1914 cello sonata.
[
459
]
[
cw
]
The 1926–1927 String Trio, Op. 20, was his first large-scale non-vocal work in more than a decade. For its 1927 publication, Webern helped Stein write an introduction emphasizing continuity with tradition:
[
461
]

Schoenberg exploited
combinatorial
properties of particular
tone rows
,
[
462
]
but Webern focused on prior aspects of a row's internal organization. He exploited small,
invariant
pitch
subsets
(or
partitions
) symmetrically
derived
via
inversion
,
retrograde
, or both (
retrograde inversion
). He understood his compositional (and
precompositional
) work with reference to ideas about growth, morphology, and unity that he found represented in Goethe's
Urpflanze
[
de
]
and in
Goethean science
more generally.
[
463
]
[
cx
]

Webern's large-scale, non-vocal music in more traditional genres,
[
cy
]
written from 1926 to 1940, has been celebrated as his most rigorous and abstract music.
[
465
]
Yet he always wrote his music and tried his new compositional procedures with concern for (or at least some latent reference to) expressivity and representation.
[
466
]
[
cz
]
In sketches for his Op. 22 quartet, Webern conceived of his themes in programmatic association with his experiences—as an "outlook into the highest region" or a "coolness of early spring (Anninger,
[
da
]
first flora,
primroses
,
anemones
,
pasqueflowers
)", for example.
[
471
]
Studying his compositional materials and sketches, Bailey Puffett wrote,
[
472
]

While writing the
Concerto for Nine Instruments, Op. 24
, Webern was inspired by the
Sator square
, which is like a
twelve-tone matrix
.
[
473
]
He concluded his
Weg zur Neuen Musik
with this
magic square
.

In Webern's late cantatas and songs,
[
db
]
George Rochberg
observed, "the principles of 'the structural spatial dimension' ... join[ed] forces with lyrico-dramatic demands".
[
474
]
Specifically in his cantatas, Bailey Puffett wrote, Webern synthesized the rigorous style of his mature instrumental works with the word painting of his
Lieder
on an orchestral scale.
[
475
]
Webern qualified the apparent connection between his cantatas and Bach's as general and referred to connections between the second cantata and the music of the
Franco-Flemish School
.
[
476
]
His textures became somewhat denser yet more
homophonic
at the surface through nonetheless
contrapuntal polyphonic
means.
[
477
]
In Op. 31/i he alternated lines and
points
, culminating twice
[
dc
]
in twelve-note
simultaneities
.
[
478
]

At his death he left sketches for the movement of an apparent third cantata (1944–1945), first planned as a concerto, setting "Das Sonnenlicht spricht" from Jone's
Lumen
cycle.
[
479
]

In his youth (1903), Webern orchestrated five or more Schubert
Lieder
for an appropriately Schubertian orchestra (strings and pairs of flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, and horns). Among these were "Der Vollmond Strahlt auf Bergeshöhn" (the Romanze from
Rosamunde
), "Tränenregen" (from
Die schöne Müllerin
), "Der Wegweiser" (from
Winterreise
), "Du bist die Ruh", and "Ihr Bild".
[
480
]

After attending
Hugo Wolf
's funeral and memorial concert (1903), he arranged three
Lieder
for a larger orchestra, adding brass, harp, and percussion to the Schubertian orchestra. He chose "Lebe wohl", "Der Knabe und das Immlein", and "Denk es, o Seele", of which only the latter was finished or wholly survived.
[
481
]

For Schoenberg's
Society for Private Musical Performances
in 1921, Webern arranged, among other music,
[
6
]
the 1888
Schatz-Walzer
(
Treasure Waltz
) of
Johann Strauss II
's
Der Zigeunerbaron
(
The Gypsy Baron
) for string quartet,
harmonium
, and piano.

In 1924 Webern arranged Liszt's
Arbeiterchor
(
Workers' Chorus
, c. 1847–1848)
[
482
]
for bass solo, mixed chorus, and large orchestra; thus Liszt's work was finally premièred
[
dd
]
when Webern conducted the first full-length concert of the Austrian Association of Workers Choir (13 and 14 March 1925). A review in the
Wiener Zeitung
(28 March 1925) read "
neu in jedem Sinne, frisch, unverbraucht, durch ihn zieht die Jugend, die Freude
" ("new in every respect, fresh, vital, pervaded by youth and joy").
[
181
]
The text (in English translation) read in part: "Let us have the adorned spades and scoops,/Come along all, who wield a sword or pen,/Come here ye, industrious, brave and strong/All who create things great or small."

In orchestrating the six-voice ricercar from Bach's
Musical Offering
, Webern timbrally defined the internal organization (or latent subsets) of the Bach's
subject
.
[
484
]
Joseph N. Straus argued that Webern (and other modernists) effectively recomposed earlier music, "projecting motivic density" onto tradition.
[
485
]
After more conservatively orchestrating two of Schubert's 1824
Six German Dances
on UE commission in 1931, he wrote Schoenberg:

Webern's music was generally considered difficult by performers and inaccessible by listeners alike.
[
487
]
"To the limited extent that it was regarded",
Milton Babbitt
observed, it represented "the ultimate in hermetic, specialized, and idiosyncratic composition".
[
488
]

Composers and performers first tended to take Webern's work, with its residual
post-Romanticism
and initial expressionism, in mostly
formalist
directions with a certain
literalism
, departing from Webern's own practices and preferences in extrapolating from elements of his late style. This became known as post-Webernism.
[
489
]
A richer, more
historically informed
understanding of Webern's music and his performance practice began to emerge in the latter half of the 20th century as scholars, especially the Moldenhauers, sought and archived
sketches
, letters, lectures, recordings, and other articles of Webern's (and others') estates.
[
df
]

In the
immediate aftermath of World War II
, Webern's marginalization under
Gleichschaltung
was appreciated, but his pan-Germanism, politics, and social attitudes (especially regarding antisemitism) were not as known or often mooted.
[
490
]
For many, like Stravinsky, Webern never compromised his artistic identity and values, but for others the matter was less simple.
[

Webern notated
articulations
,
dynamics
,
tempo rubato
, and other
musical expressions
, coaching performers to adhere to these instructions but urging them to maximize expressivity through
musical phrasing
.

This was supported by personal accounts, letters, and extant recordings of Schubert's
Deutsche Tänze
(arr. Webern) and
Berg
's
Violin Concerto
under Webern's direction.
Ian Pace
considered
Peter Stadlen
's account of Webern's coaching for
Op. 27
as indicating Webern's "desire for an extremely flexible, highly diaphanous, and almost expressively overloaded approach".
[
494

[
di
]

This aspect of Webern's work was often overlooked in his immediate post-war reception,
[
496
]
which was roughly coterminous with the
early music revival
. Stravinsky engaged with Webern and
Renaissance music
in his later music; his amanuensis Craft performed Webern as well as
Monteverdi
,
Schütz
,
Gabrieli
, and
Tallis
.
[
497
]
Many musicians performed "music that is at the same time old
and
new", as
Nicholas Cook
and Anthony Pople glossed it and as
Richard Taruskin
addressed.
J. Peter Burkholder
noted early and new music audience overlap.
[
498
]

Felix Galimir
of the Galimir Quartet told
The New York Times
(1981): "Berg asked for enormous correctness in the performance of his music. But the moment this was achieved, he asked for a very Romanticized treatment. Webern, you know, was also terribly Romantic—as a person, and when he conducted. Everything was almost over-sentimentalized. It was entirely different from what we have been led to believe today. His music should be played very freely, very emotionally."
[
499
]

Many artists portrayed Webern (often from life) in their work. Kokoschka (1912), Schiele (1917 and 1918),
B. F. Dolbin
[
de
]
(1920 and 1924), and Rederer (1934) made drawings of him. Oppenheimer (1908), Kokoschka (1914), and
Tom von Dreger
(1934) painted him. Stumpp made two lithographs of him (1927). Humplik twice sculpted him (1927 and 1928). Jone variously portrayed him (1943 lithograph, several posthumous drawings, 1945 oil painting). Rederer made a large woodcut of him (1964).
[
500
]

Schoenberg admired Webern's concision, writing in the foreword to Op. 9 upon its 1924 publication: "to express a novel in a single gesture, joy in a single breath—such concentration can only be present in proportion to the absence of self-indulgence".
[
501
]
But Berg joked about Webern's brevity.
Hendrik Andriessen
found Webern's music "pitiful" in this regard.
[

In their second (1925)
Abbruch

editors jested that "Webern's" (Mahler's) "extensive"
Symphony of a Thousand
had to be abbreviated.
[
dl

Felix Khuner
remembered Webern was "just as revolutionary" as Schoenberg.
[
503
]
In 1927,
Hans Mersmann
wrote that "Webern's music shows the frontiers and ... limits of a development which tried to outgrow Schoenberg's work."
[
504
]

Identifying with Webern as a "solitary soul" amid 1940s wartime fascism,
[
505
]
Dallapiccola independently and somewhat singularly
[
dm
]
found inspiration especially in Webern's lesser-known mid-period
Lieder
, blending its ethereal qualities and Viennese expressionism with
bel canto
.
[
506
]
Stunned by Webern's Op. 24 at its 1935 ISCM festival world première under Jalowetz in Prague, Dallapiccola's impression was of unsurpassable "aesthetic and stylistic unity".
[
507
]
He dedicated
Sex carmina alcaei
[
dn
]
"with humility and devotion" to Webern, who he met in 1942 through Schlee, coming away surprised at Webern's emphasis on "our great Central European tradition."
[
508
]
Dallapiccola's 1953
Goethe-lieder
especially recall Webern's Op. 16 in style.
[
509
]

In 1947, Schoenberg remembered and stood firm with Berg and Webern despite rumors of the latter's having "fallen into the Nazi trap":
[
do
]
"... [F]orget all that might have ... divided us. For there remains for our future what could only have begun to be realized posthumously: One will have to consider us three—Berg, Schoenberg, and Webern—as a unity, a oneness, because we believed in ideals ... with intensity and selfless devotion; nor would we ever have been deterred from them, even if those who tried might have succeeded in confounding us."
[
dp
]
For Krasner this put "'Vienna's Three Modern Classicists' into historical perspective". He summarized it as "what bound us together was our idealism."
[
510
]

After World War II, there was unprecedented engagement with Webern's music. It came to represent a universally or generally valid, systematic, and compellingly logical model of new composition, especially at the
Darmstädter Ferienkurse
.
[
515
]
René Leibowitz
performed, promulgated, and published
Schoenberg et son école
;
[
516
]
Adorno,
[
517
]
Herbert Eimert
, Scherchen,
[
518
]
and others contributed. Composers and students
[
dr
]
listened in a quasi-religious trance to Peter Stadlen's 1948 Op. 27 performance.
[
519
]

Webern's gradual innovations in schematic organization of pitch, rhythm, register, timbre, dynamics, articulation, and melodic contour; his generalization of imitative techniques such as canon and
fugue
; and his inclination toward
athematicism
, abstraction, and lyricism variously informed and oriented European and Canadian, typically
serial
or
avant-garde
composers (e.g.,
Messiaen
, Boulez,
Stockhausen
,
Luigi Nono
,
Pousseur
,
Ligeti
,
Sylvano Bussotti
,
Bruno Maderna
,
Bernd Alois Zimmermann
,
Barbara Pentland
).
[
520
]
Eimert and Stockhausen devoted a special issue of
die Reihe
to Webern's
œuvre
in 1955. UE published his lectures in 1960.
[
521
]

In the US, Babbitt
[
522
]
and initially Rochberg
[
523
]
found more in Schoenberg's twelve-tone practice.
Elliott Carter
's and
Aaron Copland
's critical ambivalence was marked by a certain enthusiasm and fascination nonetheless.
[
524
]
Craft fruitfully reintroduced Stravinsky to Webern's music, without which Stravinsky's late works would have taken different shape. Stravinsky staked his contract with
Columbia Records
to see Webern's then known music first both recorded and widely distributed.
[
525
]
Stravinsky lauded Webern's "not yet canonized art" in 1959.
[
526
]

Among the
New York School
,
John Cage
and
Morton Feldman
first met in
Carnegie Hall
's lobby, ecstatic after a performance of Op. 21 by
Dimitri Mitropoulos
and the
New York Philharmonic
. They cited the effect of its
sound
on their music.
[
527
]
They later sung the praises of
Christian Wolff
as "our Webern".

Gottfried Michael Koenig
suggested some early interest in Webern's music may have been that its concision and apparent simplicity facilitated didactic
musical analysis
.
Robert Beyer
[
de
]
criticized serial approaches to Webern's music as
reductive
, narrowly focused more on Webern's procedures than his music while neglecting timbre in their typical selection of Opp. 27–28.
[
528
]
Webern's music sounded like "a
Mondrian
canvas", "crude and unfinished", to
Karel Goeyvaerts
.
[
529
]
Wolf-Eberhard von Lewinski
criticized some Darmstadt music as "acoustically absurd [if] visually amusing" (
Darmstädter Tagblatt
[
de
]
, 1959); a
Der Kurier
article of his was headlined "Meager modern music—only interesting to look at".
[
530
]

Through late 1950s onward, Webern's work reached musicians as far removed as
Frank Zappa
,
[
535
]
yet many post-war European musicians and scholars had already begun to look beyond
[
536
]
as much as
back
at Webern in his context. Nono advocated for a more humanistic understanding of Webern's music.
[
537
]

Adorno lectured that in the prevailing climate "artists like Berg or Webern would hardly be able to make it" ("The Aging of the New Music", 1954). Against the "static idea of music" and "
total
rationalization
" of the "pointillist constructivists," he advocated for more
subjectivity
, citing
Über das Geistige in der Kunst
(1911), in which
Wassily Kandinsky
wrote: "Schoenberg's [expressionist] music leads us to where musical experience is a matter not of the ear, but of the soul—and from this point begins the music of the future."

In the 1960s, many began to describe Webern and his like as a "
dead end
".
[
538
]
[
du
]
Rochberg felt "Webern's music leaves his followers no new, unexplored territory."
[
541
]
Stravinsky judged Webern "too original ... too purely himself. ... [T]he entire world had to imitate him [and] fail; of course it will blame Webern"; he blamed post-Webernism: "[T]he music now being charged to his name can neither diminish his strength nor stale his perfection."
[
542
]

In
Votre Faust
(1960–1968), Pousseur quoted and his protagonist Henri analyzed Webern's Op. 31. Yet there were already several elements of
late
or
postmodernism
(e.g.,
eclecticism
of historical styles,
mobile
form, polyvalent roles).
[
543
]
This coincided with a wider rapprochement with Berg,
[
544
]
whose example Pousseur cited,
[
545
]
from whose music he also quoted, and whose writings he translated into French in the 1950s.
[
546
]
Boulez was "thrilled" by Berg's "universe ... never completed, always in expansion—a world so ... inexhaustible," referring to the rigorously organized, only partly twelve-tone
Chamber Concerto
.
[
dv

Engaging with Webern's atonal works by some contrast to earlier post-Webernism, both
Ferneyhough
and
Lachenmann
expanded upon and went further than Webern in attention to the smallest of details and the use of ever more radically
extended techniques
. Ferneyhough's 1967 Sonatas for string quartet included atonal sections much in the style of Webern's Op. 9, yet more intensely sustained. In a comparison to his own 1969
Air
, Lachenmann wrote of "a melody made of a
single
note ... in the viola part" of Webern's Op. 10/iv (mm. 2–4) amid "the mere ruins of the traditional linguistic context," observing that "the pure tone, now living in tonal exile, has in this new context no aesthetic advantage over pure noise" ("Hearing [Hören] is Defenseless—without Listening [Hören]", 1985).

In
Eastern Europe
, the Second Viennese School's music represented a professionally dangerous but sometimes exciting or inspiring alternative to
socialist realism
. Their influence on composers behind the
Iron Curtain
was mediated by
anti-fascist
and
-German sentiment
[
547
]
as well as
anti-formalist
cultural policies
[
548
]
and
Cold War
separation.
[
dw
]
Ligeti lamented the separation and left in 1956, noting that "after Bartók hardly any grass could grow".
[
551
]

Webern's influence predominated after the
Hungarian Revolution of 1956
, bearing on
Pál Kadosa
,
Endre Szervánszky
, and
György Kurtág
.
[
552

Among
Czechs
,
Pavel Blatný
attended the
Darmstädter Ferienkurse
and wrote music with serial techniques in the late 1960s. He returned to tonality in
Brno
and was rewarded.
[
553
]
Marek Kopelent
discovered the Second Viennese as an editor and was particularly taken by Webern.
[
554

Kopelent was blacklisted for his music and despaired, unable to attend international performances of his work.

Sergei Slonimsky

Igor Blazhkov

Philip Herschkowitz
, poverty-stricken, taught privately in Moscow with cautious emphasis on Beethoven and the tradition from which Webern emerged.
[

His pupil
Nikolai Karetnikov
taped
Glenn Gould
's 1957
Moscow Conservatory
performance of Webern's Op. 27.
[

In practice like that of Webern, Karetnikov
derived the tone row
of his
Symphony No. 4
from motives as small as two notes related by semitone.

In
Soviet Music
,
Marcel Rubin
criticized "Webern and His Followers" (1959), by contrast to Berg and Schoenberg, for going too far.
[
560

Alfred Schnittke
complained in an open letter (1961) of composers' restricted education.
[
561
]
Through Grigory Shneyerson's anti-formalist
On Music Living and Dead
(1960) and
Johannes Paul Thilman
's anti-modernist "On the Dodecaphonic Method of Composition" (1958), many (e.g.,
Eduard Artemyev
,
Victor Ekimovsky
,
Vladimir Martynov
,
Boris Tischenko
[
dx
]
) ironically learned more about what had been and even was still forbidden.
[
563
]
Kruschchev warned, "dodecaphonic music, music of noises ... this cacophonic music we totally reject. Our people cannot include such trash".
[
564
]

Through
Andrei Volkonsky
,
Lydia Davydova
recalled, Schoenberg's and Webern's music came to Russia alongside
Renaissance
and early
Baroque
music.
[
565
]
Tischenko remembered that in the 1960s, Volkonsky "was the first swallow of the avant-garde. [T]hose who came after him ... already followed in his tracks. I consider [him] the discoverer."
[
565
]
Edison Denisov
described the 1960s as his "second conservatory", crediting Volkonsky not only for introducing Webern, but also
Gesualdo
.
[
566

This tolerance did not survive the
Brezhnev
Stagnation
.
[
567

Volkonsky emigrated in 1973, Herschkowitz in 1987, and of
Khrennikov's Seven
(1979), Denisov,
Elena Firsova
,
Sofia Gubaidulina
,
Dmitri Smirnov
, and
Viktor Suslin
eventually emigrated.

Many
choreographers
set Webern's music to dance.
Martha Graham
and
George Balanchine
choreographed several works in
Episodes I
and
II
respectively (1959) as a
New York City Ballet
"novelty".
[
569

John Cranko
set
Opus 1
(1965) to Webern's Passacaglia, Op. 1.
Rudi van Dantzig

Antwoord gevend

[

and
Trisha Brown

Twelve Ton Rose
(1996).
[
572

Jiří Kylián
set only Webern's music in
No More Play
(1988) and
Sweet Dreams
(1990), more often pairing it with that of other composers in several
ballets
(1984–1995).
[

Webern's legacy, contested in the "serial wars",
[
ea

remained subject to
polemic
vicissitudes.
Musicologists
quarreled
[
575

[
eb

amid the "Restoration of the 1980s", as Martin Kaltenecker termed a
paradigm shift
from structure to perception within musicological discourse.
[
ec

Charles Rosen
scorned "historical criticism ... avoiding any serious engagement with a work or style ... one happens not to like".
[

Andreas Holzer warned of "
post-factual
tendencies".
[
577
]
[
ed
]
Pamela M. Potter advised considering "the complexity of ... day-to-day existence" under Nazism, partly in considering the relevance of composers' politics to their
canonic
status.
[
579
]
Meanwhile
Allen Forte
and Bailey Puffett formally
analyzed
Webern's atonal and twelve-tone
œuvres
respectively.

Tim Page
noted less formalist readings of Webern's work at his 1983 birth centenary.
[
580
]
The occasion "went almost unmarked",
Glenn Watkins
observed in the United States, "a fate hardly imaginable for Berg [on his] 1985 [centenary]". After Webern's mid-century "meteoric ascension and ultimate canonization",
[
581
]
Watkins described "quick shifts of interest" tapering to neglect.
[
582
]
Webern's music was established but infrequent in
standard
(repeating) orchestral
repertoire
.
[
583
]
[
ee
]
His
œuvre
was played at the
Venice Festival of Contemporary Music
(1983),
[
587

Juilliard
(1995), and the
Vienna Festival
(2004), echoing six international festivals in his name (1962–1978).
[
ef

In some obscurity (1941 or 1942), Webern had been quietly sure that "in the future even the postman will whistle my melodies!"
[
589

But many did not acquire such an
aesthetic taste
.
[
590

[
eg

He remained polarizing and provocative.

Noting this aspect of his reception, Johnson described Webern's "almost unique position in the canon of Western composers".
[

Christian Thorau argued Webern's innovations impeded his "
exoterischen Kanonisierung
".
[

By contrast to the "concert canon", Shreffler considered Webern's better standing in a "separate canon" of technical and formal innovation.
[
602

[

Burkholder argued that music of the "historicist tradition",
[
ek
]
including Webern's, was secure in "a musical museum", "for that is what the concert hall has become".
[
608

[

Mark Berry described Webern, already among Boulez's "big five", as one of five "canonical pillars of classic historical early twentieth-century modernism".
[

David H. Miller suggested Webern "achieved a certain kind of acceptance and canonization".
[

Taruskin prioritized
audience reception
, not "musical utopianism".
[

[

He excoriated the Second Viennese School's "idiosyncratic view of the past", linking Webern and Adler to
Eduard Hanslick

Franz Brendel

[

he criticized
historical determinism

Noted for his

Taruskin described his "dubious reputation" on Webern and
New Music
[
629

and was praised and criticized
[
er

by many. For
Franklin Cox
, Taruskin was an unreliable historian who opposed the Second Viennese School's "progressivist
historicist
"
emancipation of the dissonance
with a "reactionary historicist" ideology of "tonal restoration".
[
637

Pascal Decroupet observed an unquestioned "canon of polarizations" in prior histories.
[

[
es

Johnson noted the "co-existence and interaction of diverse stylistic practices" with "remarkable similarities", challenging "conservative and progressive" campism
[

and decentering
musicology

periodizations
[

via the
longue durée
of

Thus he ventured continuity
[

between the "broken
homeland

pastoral
" of Monteverdi's
L'Orfeo
and Vaughan Williams'
Pastoral
Symphony
;
[
646

[

between Webern's "evanescent images of musical fullness"
[
647

and the brief, fragmentary nature of Chopin's
Op. 28
, which Schumann likened to "
ruins

[

Building on Shreffler's and Felix Meyer's work, including
sketch
studies, as institutions like the
Paul-Sacher-Stiftung
[

acquired and made the Moldenhauers' estate accessible,
[
650

[

Johnson noted Webern's concern for the relation between
form and content
,
[

[
ew

and pursued a
hermeneutics
of Webern's (and Mahler's) music.
[
654
]
(He argued that Webern, following Mahler, fundamentally treated nature not merely as something to express or to represent musically, but as a deeper formal principle or structural model, yielding inseparably richer musical expression.)
[
655
]

Wedler argued by
antinomy
and
demythologization
that the complex, seemingly contradictory reception of Webern and his music stemmed from this
unity of opposites
imaginatively
mediated within
Webern's underlying aesthetic of musical lyricism (or musical poetry, as Schoenberg called it). Adorno termed it "
absolute
lyricism", perhaps (Wedler suggested) after Hegel, who saw concentration as the lyric's essence, permitting "the greatest wealth of steps and nuances" to
dialectically
resolve the
dilemma
between "almost dumb conciseness" and "the eloquent clarity of a [fully developed] idea".
