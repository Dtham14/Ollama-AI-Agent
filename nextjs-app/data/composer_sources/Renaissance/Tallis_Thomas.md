## Biography

Thomas Tallis
(
/
ˈ
t

/
;
[

]
also
Tallys
or
Talles
;
c.
1505
– 23 November 1585
[
n 1
]
) was an English composer of High
Renaissance music
. His compositions are primarily vocal, and he occupies a primary place in anthologies of English
choral music
. Tallis is considered one of England's greatest composers, and is honoured for his original voice in English musicianship.
[
3
]

As no records about the birth, family or childhood of Thomas Tallis exist, almost nothing is known about his early life or origins. Historians have calculated that he was born in the early part of the 16th century, towards the end of the reign of
Henry VII of England
, and estimates for the year of his birth range from 1500 to 1520.
[
4
]
His only known relative was a cousin called John Sayer. As the
surnames
Sayer
and
Tallis
both have strong connections with
Kent
, Thomas Tallis is usually thought to have been born somewhere in the county.
[
5
]

There are some suggestions that Tallis sang as a
child of the chapel
in the
Chapel Royal
, the same singing establishment which he joined as an adult.
[
6
]
[
7
]
He was probably a
chorister
at the
Benedictine
Priory of St. Mary the Virgin and St. Martin of the New Work
, in Dover, where he was later employed, but it is impossible to know whether he was educated there. He may have sung at
Canterbury Cathedral
.
[
8
]

Tallis served at court as a composer, teacher and performer for
Henry VIII
,
[
9
]
Edward VI
,
Mary I
, and
Elizabeth I
.
[
10
]
He was first designated as an organist at the chapel after 1570, although he would have been employed as an organist throughout his career.
[
11
]

He avoided the religious controversies that raged around him throughout his service to successive monarchs, though he remained, in the words of the historian
Peter Ackroyd
, an "unreformed Roman Catholic".
[
12
]
Tallis was capable of switching the style of his compositions to suit each monarch's different demands.
[
13
]
Tallis taught the composers:
William Byrd
, as later associated with
Lincoln Cathedral
;
Elway Bevin
, an organist of
Bristol Cathedral
and Gentleman of the Chapel Royal;
[
14
]
and
Sir Ferdinando Heybourne
(aka Richardson), a favourite of
Queen Elizabeth
.
[
15
]

No record of Tallis related to his career exists before 1531, when he is named in the accounts of the Kent Benedictine house
Dover Priory
.
[
8
]
He was employed there as the
organist
,
[
16
]
responsible for directing
chants
from the organ.
[
17
]
A "Thomas Tales" is named as the "
joculator organorum
" at the priory and received an annual payment of £2.
[
11
]
The account notes that he was also responsible for the direction of six
singing-boys
.
[
18
]
The priory was
dissolved
in 1535, but there is no surviving record of Tallis's departure.
[
19
]
[
11
]

Tallis's whereabouts are not known for the several months after this until mention is made of his being employed at
St Mary-at-Hill
in London's
Billingsgate
ward.
[
19
]
Records show he was paid four half-yearly payments from 1536 to 1538, with the last payment being specified for services—as either a singer or an organist—for the year up to 25 March 1538.
[
11
]
[
20
]

Towards the end of 1538 Tallis moved to a large
Augustinian
monastery,
Waltham Abbey
in
Essex
,
[
21
]
after he had come into contact with the abbot, whose London home was near to St Mary-at-Hill.
[
22
]
At Waltham, Tallis became a senior member.
[
21
]
When the abbey, too, was
dissolved
in March 1540, Tallis left without receiving a pension (since he had only recently been employed there), and was instead given a one-off payment of 40
shillings
. He took away a volume of musical treatises copied by
John Wylde
, once a
preceptor
at Waltham. Among its contents was a
treatise
by
Leonel Power
that prohibited consecutive
unisons
,
fifths
, and
octaves
; the last page is inscribed with his name.
[
11
]
[
6
]

By the summer of 1540 Tallis had moved to the formerly monastic but recently
secularised
Canterbury Cathedral
, where his name heads the list of singers in the newly expanded choir of 10 boys and 12 men. Tallis brought with him several manuscripts of his early votive works for frequent
Sarum use
.
[
23
]
He remained there for two years.
[
21
]
[
11
]

Tallis's employment in the Chapel Royal probably began in 1543. His name appears on a 1544
lay subsidy roll
and is listed in a later document. It is possible that he was connected with the court when at St Mary-at-Hill, since in 1577 Tallis claimed to have "served yo[u]r Ma[jes]tie and yo[u]r Royall ancestors these fortie yeres". He may have been responsible for teaching the boys of the choir keyboard and composition.
[
11
]
Tallis oversaw the will of
Richard Bower
, who was
Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal
.
[
24
]

Around 1552, Tallis married, probably for the first time, to Joan, the widow of a gentleman of the Chapel Royal. Like many other members of the royal household choir, Tallis and his wife lived in
Greenwich
,
[
22
]
although it is not known if he ever owned his house there. He probably rented a house, by tradition in Stockwell Street.
[
11
]
According to Tallis' epitaph and Joan Tallis' will, there were no children of the marriage.
[
11
]
[
25
]
In the 1550s, and 1560s, it is likely that
William Byrd
was taught the organ and some composition by Tallis ("bred up to Musick under Tho. Tallys").
[
26
]
Byrd kept a close relationship to Tallis, as Tallis went on to become the godfather of Byrd's second son, Thomas Byrd.
[
27
]

Queen Mary I, who commissioned a mass and several settings for
Divine Office
from Tallis,
[
28
]
granted him a lease on a manor in Kent which provided a comfortable annual income.
[
29
]
He was present at her funeral on 13 December 1558 and at the coronation of Elizabeth I the following month.
[
22
]
A setting of the
Requiem
composed by Tallis for the funeral of Mary has been lost.
[
30
]
[
31
]
[
32
]

Tallis was an eminent figure in Elizabeth's household chapel, but as he aged he became gradually less prominent.
[
22
]
In 1575, Elizabeth granted Tallis and Byrd a 21-year
monopoly
for
polyphonic music
[
33
]
and a
patent
to print and publish "set songe or songes in parts", one of the first arrangements of its kind in England.
[
34
]
Tallis and Byrd were given exclusive rights to print any music in any language, including
English
,
Latin
,
French
, and
Italian
,
[
33
]
and they had sole use of the paper used in printing music. The only publication made under the monopoly while Tallis was still alive was the 1575
Cantiones quae ab argumento sacrae vocantur
, which was prefaced by Sir Ferdinando Heybourne, who wrote that Tallis and Byrd intended to take their place among the great composers of Europe: "
Lassus
,
Gombert
, and
Ferrabosco
".
[
15
]
It did not sell well, and they were forced to appeal to Elizabeth for support.
[
33
]
People were wary of the new publications, the sale of which was not helped by both men being
Roman Catholics
.
[
34
]
As Catholics, Byrd and Tallis were forbidden to sell imported music, and were refused any rights to music
fonts
, or printing patents not under their command. They lacked their own printing press.
[
35
]
A second petition in 1577 resulted in the grant of a joint lease of
crown lands
to the two composers.
[
11
]

After the 1575 publication, Tallis is thought to have ceased active composition, as no works from these final years survive.
[
4
]
The sombre,
Post-Exilic
texts for Tallis' final surviving works of 1575,
In Jejunio
and
Derelinquat Impius,
indicate that Tallis was becoming increasingly involved with the
recusant
communities facing persecution,
[
36
]
as was Byrd; the
Paget Household
, known for its devout Catholicism until
Thomas Paget's attainting in 1587
, was a musical centre where "songes of Mr Byrdes and Mr Tallys’ were sung."
[
25
]
Thomas Tallis was closely associated with the wealthy recusant Anthony Roper,
[
37
]
who was the grandson of
Sir Thomas More
[
38
]
and the owner of the Theewes
Claviorganum
.
[
39
]

Late in his life, Tallis lived in
Greenwich
, possibly close to the royal
Palace of Placentia
; tradition holds that he lived on Stockwell Street.
[
11
]
He was recorded as a member of Elizabeth I's household in June 1585, and wrote his
will
in August that year.
[
40
]
He died in his house in
Greenwich
on 20 or 23 November; the different dates are from a register and the Chapel Royal.
[
41
]
[
42
]
In his will he left £3.6s.8d. to "my company the gentlemen of Her Majesty's Chapel towards their feast." Thomas Byrd received Tallis' share of the monopoly
[
15
]
although it was his father, William Byrd, who would utilise it.

He was buried in the chancel of
St Alfege Church, Greenwich
.
[
41
]
A brass memorial plate placed there after the death of his wife (but before the death of Elizabeth (
ONDB
)) is now lost.
[
41
]
His remains may have been discarded by labourers during the 1710s, when the church was rebuilt.
[
43
]

Tallis' epitaph on a brass
plaque
, lost in the subsequent rebuilding of the church, was recorded by the English clergyman
John Strype
in his 1720 edition of
John Stow
's
Survey of London
[
11
]
[
44
]
It was most likely written by Henry Stanford: a recusant tutor to the Paget Household.
[
15
]

On learning of Tallis' death, William Byrd wrote
Ye Sacred Muses
, his musical elegy to his colleague and mentor. Tallis' widow Joan, whose will is dated 12 June 1587, survived him by nearly four years
[
11
]
[
22
]
and spent the rest of her life in the care of Richard Cranwell, a gentleman of the Chapel Royal.
[
25
]
Anthony Roper received Tallis' gilt cup in Joan's will for the "good favours showed to [her] late husband"
[
37
]
[
25
]
and William Byrd received Tallis' gilt bowl.

The earliest surviving works by Tallis are
Alleluia: Ora pro nobis
,
Euge Caeli Porta
,
Magnificat for four voices
,
[
45
]
and three devotional
antiphons
to the
Virgin Mary
:
Salve intemerata
, a precocious work of Tallis, with the oldest manuscript dating to the 1520s (London, British Library, Ms. Harley 1709);
[
46
]
[
47
]
Ave Dei Patris filia
; and
Ave rosa sine spinis
. Votive antiphons were sung in the evening after the
last service of the day
. Tallis' early output is composed entirely in the
English Votive Style
that was cultivated in England from the 1470s to the 1540s. Tallis used antiphons composed by
John Taverner
and
Robert Fayrfax
[
48
]
as models for composing his own antiphons. Taverner in particular is
quoted
in
Salve intemerata
, and
Dum transisset sabbatum.
[
48
]
Characteristics of the votive style, such as high, sustained treble lines and lengthy solo verses, were just beginning to be supplanted by the more succinct phrasing of continental traditions by the 1530s, making
Missa Salve Intemerata
(Tallis' first of three complete masses, and his only
parody mass
to be completed)
[
49
]
more modern in technique than the antiphon from which it is derived.
[
50
]

Gaude gloriosa Dei mater
was previously thought to have been one of many revivalist votive antiphons composed in honour of
Queen Mary I
, in a similar vein to William Mundy's
Vox Patris caelestis
. This is due to
Gaude gloriosa
being more advanced than the rest of Tallis' early output, indicating the work of an older, more mature composer.
[
51
]
However,
Gaude gloriosa
's dating was revised after renovations at
Corpus Christi College, Oxford
in 1978 revealed earlier fragments of
Gaude gloriosa
that use an English text translated by
Queen Katherine Parr
.
[
52
]
This means the antiphon was likely composed in the 1540s, or even earlier, with its original Latin text referencing the "Gaude" Window in the west transept of Canterbury Cathedral.
[
53
]
The cathedral was Tallis' previous workplace before his appointment to the Chapel Royal. It was only after becoming a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal that Tallis received his commission for
Gaude gloriosa
's English
contrafactum
,
Se Lord and behold
, which was intended for use in
Henry VIII's French campaign
and the capture of
Boulogne
in 1544.
[
54
]

At Canterbury Cathedral, Thomas Tallis was caught between
Archbishop Thomas Cranmer
's push for reform, and resistance from the more conservative members of the cathedral's chapter.
[
15
]
Cranmer recommended a syllabic style of music where each syllable is sung to one pitch, as his instructions make clear for the setting of the 1544
English Litany
.
[
55
]
As a result, the writing of Tallis became more simple. Tallis'
Mass for Four Voices
, while in Latin, is written in syllabic
homophony
, with a diminished use of
melisma
.
[
56
]

The reformed Anglican liturgy was inaugurated during the short reign of
Edward VI
(1547–53),
[
57
]
and Tallis began to write anthems set to English words, as well as
services
for the
Book of Common Prayer
. Tallis' English setting for the
Benedictus
stylistically dates from this period, although it remained in use as Byrd quoted Tallis' "which hath bene since the world began" melody in his own
Great Service.
[
58
]
Tallis' famous
If ye love me
certainly dates from the reign of Edward VI, as the
Wanley Partbook
of 1549-1552 is the earliest source for the anthem.
[
59
]

Queen Mary
set about undoing some of the religious reforms of the preceding decades, following her accession in 1553. Mary restored the
Sarum Rite
, and the compositional style of the Chapel Royal reverted to the votive style prevalent early in the century,
[
60
]
albeit in a form even more steeped in continental practices than that emerging in the 1530s. The marriage between Mary and
Prince Philip of Spain
allowed for a new artistic exchange between England and Spain.
Philip's chapel choir
accompanied him to England in 1554.
[
61
]
Therefore, Tallis was exposed to visiting continental composers, as evident in
Suscipe quaeso Domine
, which i
s
a non-liturgical 7-voice motet composed to celebrate the end of the
English schism
.
Suscipe quaeso
is written in a low-pitched Flemish style to suit the singing tradition of Philip's choir.
[
28
]
Loquebantur variis linguis
and
Miserere nostri
have the same 7-voice-scoring, meaning that they were also composed with Philip's singers in mind.
[
28
]
Miserere nostri
is notably written in the complex canonical technique of the continent
[
62
]
with its use of multiple
augmentative prolations.
[
63
]

Missa Puer natus est nobis
, likely composed in December 1554 for the both chapel choirs, is more conservative in that it is composed around a festive
cantus firmus
"
Puer natus est nobis
" that alludes to the birth of a boy for England. Queen Mary believed she was pregnant from 1554-1555, and that the Catholic succession was to be secured,
[
64
]
hence the large, celebratory scale of
Missa Puer natus
. The mass has characteristics of the English votive style, such as
cross-relations
, yet the mass also has characteristics of the
Flemish tradition
.
[
28
]
In the tenor part, there are cryptic, puzzle-like patterns made from the varying note lengths with which Tallis modified the cantus firmus. Milsom writes that the patterns are "almost cabbalistic", while Wulfstan suggests that Tallis' use of patterns actually resemble
Ockeghem
's mathematical "games" with cantus firmi.
[
65
]
Philips writes that the overall
esoteric
significance is "difficult to discern".
[
61
]

Some of Tallis' keyboard works were compiled by Thomas Mulliner in a manuscript copybook called
The Mulliner Book
before Queen Elizabeth's reign, and may have been used by the queen herself when she was younger.
[
66
]
Following Elizabeth's accession, the
Act of Uniformity
abolished the Roman Liturgy
[
3
]
and firmly established the
Book of Common Prayer
.
[
67
]
Composers resumed writing English anthems, although the practice continued of setting Latin texts among composers employed by Elizabeth's Chapel Royal.
[
50
]

The religious authorities at the beginning of Elizabeth's reign, being Protestant, tended to discourage polyphony in church unless the words were clearly audible or, as the
1559 Injunctions
stated, "playnelye understanded, as if it were read without singing".
[
68
]
Tallis wrote
nine psalm chant tunes
for four voices for Archbishop
Matthew Parker
's Psalter published in 1567.
[
69
]
One of the nine tunes was the "Third Mode Melody" which inspired the composition of
Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis
by
Ralph Vaughan Williams
in 1910.
[
70
]
Another of the tunes, a setting of
Psalm 67
, became known as "Tallis's Canon". A version of it published by
Thomas Ravenscroft
was used as the tune for
Thomas Ken
's "All praise to thee, my God, this night".
[
71
]

The Injunctions, however, also allowed a more elaborate piece of music to be sung in church at certain times of the day.
[
68
]
Tallis' more complex Elizabethan
anthems
and
motets
may have been sung in this context, or alternatively by the many families who sang sacred polyphony at home.
[
72
]
Although older works from the reigns of Henry and Queen Mary continued to be copied and distributed, the votive style was superseded by a modern, highly-
imitative
method of counterpoint,
[
73
]
typical of late sixteenth-century choral traditions.
[
74
]
[
75
]
Tallis' better-known works from the Elizabethan years that employ this method include his settings of the
Lamentations of Jeremiah the Prophet
[
29
]
for the
Holy Week
, the motet
O nata lux
, and
Spem in alium
.

Spem in alium
is written for eight five-voice choirs, and is thought to have been commissioned by the Earl of Arundel upon hearing a secret performance of
Alessandro Striggio
's
Missa sopra Ecco sì beato giorno
or  his 40-part motet,
Ecce beatam lucem
.
Spem in alium
takes its text from the apocryphal
Book of Judith
that concerns the slaying of
Holofernes
in order to save
Israel
. Milsom proposes the notion that the Arundel or the Duke of Norfolk, both of whom had Catholic leanings, with the latter implicated in the
Ridolfi plot
, might have commissioned the motet for a text that has covert political meaning, as an allegory for an eventual
assassination
of Elizabeth.
[
76
]
Despite the allegorical association, and
Spem in alium
appearing in the
Nonsuch palace
catalogue for its presumed performance with Arundel and Norfolk in attendance, there is no evidence that Tallis was involved in the plot himself.
[
77
]
Spem in alium
has unique numerology: there are 40 voices for
40 days
of Christ in the Desert, and the motet's length of 69
'longs'
adds up to T-A-L-L-I-S in Latin letters.
[
78
]

Toward the end of his life, Tallis continued to innovate. Two large-scale keyboard works,
Felix namque I
and
Felix namque II
, can be found in the
Fitzwilliam Virginal Book (FVB 109 & FVB 110)
and are composed in a virtuosic manner unparalleled by any other European keyboard tradition of the period.
[
79
]
[
80
]
Tallis' secular output increased towards the end of his compositional career, as he produced two
In Nomines
,
a
Fantasy
, a
Solfing Song
(
Ut-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol
), one keyboard
Lesson in Two Parts
(also attrib.
John Bull
) and English songs such as
When shall my sorrowful sighing slack?
The latter was popular enough to appear in English and Scottish sources.
[
73
]
O sacrum convivium
and
Salvator mundi
may also have been written as secular fantasias for
viols
before being given liturgical texts for the
1575 Cantiones sacrae
.
[
73
]
[
81
]

In the Baldwin Partbooks, two psalm settings survive from Tallis:
[
82
]
Domine
quis habitabit
and
Laudate Dominum omnes gentes
.
Domine quis habitabit
is the longer of the two, and is written in the Flemish style.
[
83
]
Laudate Dominum
, while shorter, is written in a more sprung, lively Elizabethan style.
Laudate Dominum
made an impression on the young William Byrd, who used the motet as a model for his own
Laudate pueri.
[
84
]
Tallis was willing to draw upon his experience in adopting Flemish influences, while also retaining English character in his music through the use of
English cadences.
[
28
]

Tallis was experimental in his final known compositions in the
1575 Cantiones sacrae
:
In jejunio
has a high amount of
word-painting
, with the motet being purposely and unusually printed at a low pitch
[
85
]
to reflect the sorrowful nature of the Lenten text.
[
86
]
Derelinquat impius
is simply bizarre in that it defies any initial tonal centre. Continuous peregrinations and eccentric seventh intervals at every "misericors est"
[
87
]
convey the waywardness of the wicked in the text.
[
88
]

Tallis is remembered as primarily a composer of
sacred
vocal music, in part because of the small output of instrumental and secular music that can be successfully attributed to him.
[
89
]
Records are incomplete on his works from previous periods; 11 of his 18 Latin-texted pieces from Elizabeth's reign were published, "which ensured their survival in a way not available to the earlier material".
[
90
]
Tallis was never referred to as a "father of
English Church music
" in his lifetime (unlike Byrd, who was called a "Father of Musicke" in 17th-century chapel rolls); the epithet for Tallis was a product of the Victorian revival.
[
91
]
Tallis, nevertheless, was highly revered, with
John Baldwin
, compiler of the Baldwin Partbooks, naming him as one of the greatest composers of the period, although giving much more deference to
Mundy
as one of the "Queen's Pallis".
[
92
]
Some of Tallis' works were copied by a scribe of
Edward Paston
, who himself gifted copies to another musician and recusant,
Sir John Petre
.
[
93
]
Byrd modelled his
Great Service
and
Laudate pueri
on earlier settings by Tallis.
[
58
]
[
84
]
Although Tallis did progress with the continuing changes in English music, his surviving works became outdated by the
English Madrigal period
and the direct influence of Tallis' music waned.
Thomas Morley
, in his 1597
Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke,
names "
Fairfax
,
Taverner
,
Sheppard
, Mundy,
White
,
Parsons
, W. Byrde" as equals to
Lassus
, and among the greatest composers of their day. Tallis has quite obviously been omitted.
[
94
]

Modern scholars generally believe that Tallis stood out among other important composers of the time, including
Christopher Tye
and
Robert White
. The author and composer
Ernest Walker
wrote that "he had more versatility of style" than Tye and White, and "his general handling of his material was more consistently easy and certain".
[
95
]
John Milsom, musicologist and editor of
early music
scores, wrote that Tallis modified and revised his scores far more than
John Sheppard
and White, deliberately aligning later copies of his older works to a newer continental technique of
imitative counterpoint
.
[
96
]
David Allinson, musicologist and director of music at
Canterbury Christ Church University
, commented in a 2005 NPR segment that Tallis' "
Spem in alium
is about twenty times better'" than Striggio's 40-part motet because "where the Striggio is content to rely on big, harmonic effects and contrasts, Tallis' piece is a truly woven polyphonic piece of music."
[
97
]
Also in 2005, Tess Knighton, musicologist and historian, wrote that Tallis was, "undoubtably a genius".
[
98
]

In 1971, the
Thomas Tallis School
in
Kidbrooke
opened, a mixed
comprehensive school
named after the composer.

Most of Tallis' music that remained in continuous use following his death was his music in the English language,
[
99
]
mostly notably his Dorian Service, individual movement settings such as the
Benedictus
and
Te Deum for means
, two sets of responses, two double-chants and various other hymns, psalms and anthems for the
Book of Common Prayer
. It was only in the
Victorian period
, when interest in
early music
began to increase, that
Spem in alium
was rediscovered and began to be experimented with immediately.
[
99
]
20th century composers, such as
Ralph Vaughan Williams
and
Herbert Howells
, borrowed Tallis' themes for use in their own music. In the 1920s, the monumental series
Tudor Church Music
, produced with the support of the
Carnegie Trust
, revived Tallis' Latin music from across his career.
R. R. Terry
, chairman of the Carnegie trust at the time, pushed for the revival of Tudor church music in order to increase the choral repertoire for use at
Westminster Cathedral
.

Early music groups, such as the
Clerkes of Oxenford
and
The Tallis Scholars
, further contributed to interest in Tallis' Latin music. Chapelle du Roi recorded the complete works of Tallis in 2005 to celebrate 500 years since the estimated birth of Thomas Tallis.

Alamire also recorded

for their 2017 album Queen Katherine Parr and Songs of Reformation under the label Obsidian.

No contemporaneous portrait of Tallis survives; the one painted by
Gerard Vandergucht
dates from 150 years after the composer's death, and there is no reason to suppose that it is a fair likeness. In a rare existing copy of his
blackletter
signature, he spelled his name "Tallys".
