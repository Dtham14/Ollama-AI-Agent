ⓘ
; 27 October 1782 – 27 May 1840) was an Italian
violinist
and composer. He was the most celebrated violin
virtuoso
of his time, and left his mark as one of the pillars of modern violin technique. His
24 Caprices for Solo Violin Op. 1
are among the best known of his compositions and have served as an inspiration for many prominent composers.

Son of a
ship chandler
from
Genoa
, Paganini showed great gifts for music from an early age and studied under
Alessandro Rolla
,
Ferdinando Paer
and
Gasparo Ghiretti
. Accompanied by his father, he toured northern Italy extensively as a teenager. By 1805 he had come into the service of Napoleon's sister,
Elisa Bonaparte
, who then ruled
Lucca
where Paganini was first violin. From 1809 on he returned to touring and achieved continental fame in the subsequent two and a half decades, developing a reputation for his technical brilliance and showmanship, as well as his extravagant, philandering lifestyle. Paganini ended his concert career in 1834 amid declining health, and the failure of his Paris casino left him in financial ruin. He retired to southern France and died in
Nice
in 1840 at the age of 57.

Niccolò Paganini was born in
Genoa
(then capital of the
Republic of Genoa
) on 27 October 1782, the third of the six children of Antonio and Teresa (née Bocciardo) Paganini.

Antonio Paganini was an unsuccessful
ship chandler
,
[

]
but he managed to supplement his income by working as a musician and by selling
mandolins
.
[

: 11
At the age of five, Paganini started learning the mandolin from his father and moved to the violin by the age of seven. His musical talents were quickly recognized, earning him numerous scholarships for violin lessons. The young Paganini studied under various local violinists, including Giovanni Servetto and Giacomo Costa, but his progress quickly outpaced their abilities. Paganini and his father then traveled to
Parma
to seek further guidance from
Alessandro Rolla
. But upon listening to Paganini's playing, Rolla immediately referred him to his own teacher,
Ferdinando Paer
and, later, Paer's own teacher,
Gasparo Ghiretti
.

The French invaded northern Italy in March 1796, and the political situation in Genoa became unstable. The Paganinis sought refuge in their country property in Romairone, near
Bolzaneto
. It was in this period that Paganini is thought to have developed his relationship with the guitar.
[

]
: 18
He mastered the guitar, but preferred to play it in exclusively intimate, rather than public concerts.
[

]
He later described the guitar as his "constant companion" on his concert tours. By 1800, Paganini and his father traveled to
Livorno
, where Paganini played in concerts and his father resumed his maritime work. In 1801, the 18-year-old Paganini was appointed first violin of the
Republic of Lucca
, but a substantial portion of his income came from freelancing. His fame as a violinist was matched only by his reputation as a gambler and philanderer.

In 1805, Lucca was annexed by
Napoleonic
France, and the region was ceded to Napoleon's sister,
Elisa Bonaparte
. Paganini became a violinist for the Baciocchi court, while giving private lessons to Elisa's husband,
Felice
for ten years. During this time, his wife and Paganini were also carrying on a romantic affair.
[

In 1807, Baciocchi became the
Grand Duchess of Tuscany
and her court was transferred to
Florence
. Paganini was part of the entourage but, towards the end of 1809, he left Baciocchi to resume his freelance career.

For the next few years, Paganini returned to touring in the areas surrounding Parma and Genoa. Though he was very popular with the local audience, he was still not very well known in the rest of Europe. His first break came from an 1813 concert at
La Scala
in Milan. The concert was a great success. As a result, Paganini began to attract the attention of other prominent, though more conservative, musicians across Europe. His early encounters with
Charles Philippe Lafont
and
Louis Spohr
created intense rivalry.

In 1827,
Pope Leo XII
honoured Paganini with the
Order of the Golden Spur
.
[

His fame spread across Europe with a concert tour that started in Vienna in August 1828, stopping in every major European city in Germany, Poland, and Bohemia until February 1831 in Strasbourg. This was followed by tours in Paris and Britain. His technical ability and his willingness to display it received much critical acclaim. In addition to his own compositions, theme and variations being the most popular, Paganini also performed modified versions of works (primarily concertos) written by his early contemporaries, such as
Rodolphe Kreutzer
and
Giovanni Battista Viotti
.

Paganini's travels also brought him into contact with eminent guitar virtuosi of the day, including
Ferdinando Carulli
in Paris and
Mauro Giuliani
in Vienna.

Throughout his life, Paganini was no stranger to chronic illnesses. Although no definite medical proof exists, it has been later theorized that he might have been affected by
Marfan syndrome
[
8
]
[
9
]
or
Ehlers–Danlos syndrome
.
[
10
]
His frequent concert schedule, as well as his extravagant lifestyle, may have affected his health. Paganini was diagnosed with
syphilis
as early as 1822, and his remedy, which included
mercury
and
opium
, came with serious physical and psychological side effects. In 1834, while still in Paris, he was treated for
tuberculosis
.

In September 1834, Paganini put an end to his concert career and returned to Genoa. Contrary to popular beliefs involving his wishing to keep his music and techniques secret, Paganini devoted his time to the publication of his compositions and violin methods. He accepted students, of whom two enjoyed moderate success: violinist
Camillo Sivori
and cellist Gaetano Ciandelli. Neither, however, considered Paganini helpful or inspirational. In 1835, Paganini returned to Parma, this time under the employ of
Archduchess
Marie Louise
of Austria, Napoleon's second wife. He was in charge of reorganizing her court orchestra, but he eventually conflicted with the players and court, so his visions never saw completion. In Paris, he befriended the 11-year-old Polish virtuoso
Apollinaire de Kontski
, giving him some lessons and a signed testimonial. It was widely put about, falsely, that Paganini was so impressed with de Kontski's skills that he bequeathed him his violins and manuscripts.
[

In 1836, Paganini returned to Paris to set up a casino. Its immediate failure left him in financial ruin, and he auctioned off his personal effects, including his musical instruments, to recoup his losses. At Christmas of 1838, he left Paris for Marseille and, after a brief stay, traveled to Nice where his condition worsened. In May 1840, the Bishop of Nice sent Paganini a local parish priest to perform the
last rites
. Paganini assumed the sacrament was premature, and refused.
[

]

A week later, on 27 May 1840, the 57-year-old Paganini died from internal hemorrhaging before a priest could be summoned. Because of this, and his widely rumored association with the devil, the Church denied his body a Catholic burial in Genoa. It took four years and an appeal to the Pope before the Church let his body be transported to Genoa, but it was still not buried. His body was finally buried in 1876, in a cemetery in Parma. In 1893, the Czech violinist
František Ondříček
persuaded Paganini's grandson, Attila, to allow a viewing of the violinist's body. After this episode, Paganini's body was finally reinterred in a new cemetery in Parma in 1896.
[

Though having no shortage of romantic conquests, Paganini was seriously involved with a singer named Antonia Bianchi from Como, whom he met in Milan in 1813. The two gave concerts together throughout Italy. They had a son, Achille Ciro Alessandro, born on 23 July 1825 in
Palermo
and baptized at San Bartolomeo's. They never legalized their union and it ended around April 1828 in Vienna. Paganini brought Achille on his European tours, and Achille later accompanied his father until the latter's death.

Throughout his career, Paganini also became close friends with composers
Gioachino Rossini
and
Hector Berlioz
. Rossini and Paganini met in Bologna in the summer of 1818. In January 1821, on his return from Naples, Paganini met Rossini again in Rome, just in time to become the substitute conductor for Rossini's opera
Matilde di Shabran
, upon the sudden death of the original conductor. Paganini's efforts earned great gratitude from Rossini.
[

Paganini met Berlioz in Paris in 1833 and they continued to correspond. He commissioned a piece from the composer, but was not satisfied with the resultant four-movement piece for orchestra and viola obbligato,
Harold en Italie
. He never performed it; instead, it was premiered a year later by violist
Christian Urhan
. He did, however, write his own
Sonata per Gran Viola
Op. 35 (with orchestra or guitar accompaniment). Despite his alleged lack of interest in
Harold
, Paganini often referred to Berlioz as the resurrection of
Beethoven
and, towards the end of his life, he gave large sums to the composer. They shared an active interest in the guitar, which they both played and used in compositions. Paganini gave Berlioz a guitar, which they both signed on its
sound box
.
[

Paganini was in possession of a number of fine stringed instruments, including 11
Stradivari
at the time of his death.
[
15
]
More legendary than these were the circumstances under which he obtained (and lost) some of them. While Paganini was still a teenager in
Livorno
, a wealthy businessman named Livron lent him a violin, made by the master
luthier
Giuseppe Guarneri
, for a concert. Livron was so impressed with Paganini's playing that he refused to take it back. This particular violin came to be known as
Il Cannone Guarnerius
("The Cannon of Guarnieri") because of its powerful voice and resonance.
[

Other instruments associated with Paganini include the
Antonio
Amati
1600, the
Nicolò Amati
1657, the
Paganini-Desaint
1680 Stradivari, the
Guarneri-filius
Andrea
1706, the
Le Brun
1712 Stradivari, the
Vuillaume

Bergonzi
, the
Hubay
1726 Stradivari, and the
Comte Cozio di Salabue
1727 violins; the
Countess of Flanders

, and the
Mendelssohn
1731 Stradivari violas; the
Piatti
1700
Goffriller
, the
Stanlein
1707 Stradivari, and the
Ladenburg
1736 Stradivari cellos; and the
Grobert of Mirecourt
1820 (guitar).
[

]

Of his guitars, there is little evidence remaining of his various choices of instrument. The aforementioned guitar that he gave to Berlioz is a French instrument made by one Grobert of
Mirecourt
. The luthier made his instrument in the style of
René Lacôte
, a more well-known Paris-based guitar-maker. It is preserved and on display in the
Musée de la Musique
in Paris.
[

Of the guitars he owned through his life, there was an instrument by Gennaro Fabricatore that he had refused to sell even in his periods of financial stress, and was among the instruments in his possession at the time of his death.

The Israeli violinist
Ivry Gitlis
once referred to Paganini as a phenomenon rather than a development. Though some of the techniques frequently employed by Paganini were already present, most accomplished violinists of the time focused on intonation and bowing techniques.
Arcangelo Corelli
(1653–1713) was considered a pioneer in transforming the violin from an ensemble instrument to a solo instrument. Other notable violinists included
Antonio Vivaldi
(1678–1741) and
Giuseppe Tartini
(1692–1770), who, in their compositions, reflected the increasing technical and musical demands on the violinist. Although the role of the violin in music drastically changed through this period, progress in violin technique was steady but slow.

Much of Paganini's playing (and his violin composition) was influenced by two violinists,
Pietro Locatelli
(1693–1746) and
August Duranowski
(Auguste Frédéric Durand) (1770–1834). During Paganini's study in Parma, he came across the 24 Caprices of Locatelli (entitled
L'arte di nuova modulazione – Capricci enigmatici
or
The art of the new style – the enigmatic caprices
). Published in the 1730s, they were shunned by the musical authorities for their technical innovations, and were forgotten by the musical community at large. Around the same time, Durand, a former student of
Giovanni Battista Viotti
(1755–1824), became a celebrated violinist. He was renowned for his use of harmonics, both natural and artificial (which had previously not been attempted in performance), and the left hand
pizzicato
in his performance.
[
19
]
Paganini was impressed by Durand's innovations and showmanship, which later also became the hallmarks of the young violin virtuoso. Paganini was instrumental in the revival and popularization of these violinistic techniques.

Another aspect of Paganini's violin techniques concerned his flexibility. He had exceptionally long fingers and was capable of playing three octaves across four strings in a hand span, an extraordinary feat even by today's standards.
[
20
]

Paganini composed his own works to play exclusively in his concerts, all of which profoundly influenced the evolution of violin technique. His
24 Caprices
were likely composed between 1805 and 1809, while he was in the service of the Baciocchi court. Also during this period, he composed the majority of the solo pieces, duo-sonatas, trios, and quartets for the guitar, either as a solo instrument or with strings. These chamber works may have been inspired by the publication, in Lucca, of the guitar quintets of Boccherini. Many of his variations, including
Le Streghe
,
The Carnival of Venice
, and
Nel cor più non mi sento
, were composed, or at least first performed, before his European concert tour. His
six violin concertos
were written between 1817 and 1830.
[
21
]

Generally speaking, Paganini's compositions were technically imaginative, and the
timbre
of the instrument was greatly expanded as a result of these works. Sounds of different musical instruments and animals were often imitated. One such composition was titled
Il Fandango Spanolo
(The Spanish Dance), which featured a series of humorous imitations of farm animals. Even more outrageous was a solo piece
Duetto Amoroso
, in which the sighs and groans of lovers were intimately depicted on the violin. There survives a manuscript of the
Duetto
, which has been recorded. The existence of the
Fandango
is known only through concert posters.
[
22
]

Eugène Ysaÿe
criticized Paganini's works for lacking characteristics of true polyphonism.
[
23
]
Yehudi Menuhin
, on the other hand, suggested that this might have been the result of Paganini's reliance on the guitar (in lieu of the piano) as an aid in composition.
[
16
]
The orchestral parts for his concertos were often polite, unadventurous, and clearly supportive of the soloist. In this, his style is consistent with that of other Italian composers such as
Giovanni Paisiello
, Gioachino Rossini, and
Gaetano Donizetti
, who were influenced by the guitar-song milieu of Naples during this period.
[
24
]

Paganini's "La Campanella" and the
A minor Caprice (No. 24)
have inspired many composers, including
Franz Liszt
,
Robert Schumann
,
Johannes Brahms
,
Sergei Rachmaninoff
,
Boris Blacher
,
Andrew Lloyd Webber
,
George Rochberg
, and
Witold Lutosławski
, all of whom wrote variations on these works.

Notable works inspired by compositions of Paganini include:

The
Caprice No. 24
in A minor
, Op. 1, (
Tema con variazioni
) has been the basis of works by many other composers. Notable examples include
Brahms
's
Variations on a Theme of Paganini
and
Rachmaninoff
's
Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini
.

In 1904 the
Genoa Conservatory
was renamed the "Conservatorio Niccolò Paganini" in honor of the composer.
[
25
]
The conservatory is also host to the
Paganini Competition
(
Premio Paganini
); an international violin competition created in 1954.

In 1972 the State of Italy purchased a large collection of Niccolò Paganini manuscripts from the W. Heyer Library of Cologne. They are housed at the
Biblioteca Casanatense
in Rome.
[
26
]

In 1982 the city of Genoa commissioned a thematic catalogue of music by Paganini, edited by Maria Rosa Moretti and Anna Sorrento, hence the abbreviation "MS" assigned to his catalogued works.
[

A
minor planet
2859 Paganini
discovered in 1978 by Soviet astronomer
Nikolai Chernykh
is named after him.
[

Although no photographs of Paganini are known to exist, in 1900 Italian violin maker
Giuseppe Fiorini
forged the now famous fake
daguerreotype
of the celebrated violinist.
[
29
]
So well in fact, that even the great classical author and conversationalist Arthur M. Abell was led to believe it to be true, reprinting the image in the 22 January 1901 issue of the
Musical Courier
.
[

]

Paganini has been portrayed by a number of actors in film and television productions, including
Stewart Granger
in the 1946 biographical portrait
The Magic Bow
, Roxy Roth in
A Song to Remember
(1945),
Klaus Kinski
in
Kinski Paganini
(1989), and
David Garrett
in
The Devil's Violinist
(2013).

In the Soviet 1982 miniseries
Niccolo Paganini
, the musician was portrayed by the Armenian actor
Vladimir Msryan
. The series focuses on Paganini's relationship with the Roman Catholic Church. Another Soviet actor,
Armen Dzhigarkhanyan
, played Paganini's fictionalized arch-rival, an insidious
Jesuit
official. The information in the series is generally spurious, and it also plays to some of the myths and legends rampant during the musician's lifetime. One memorable scene shows Paganini's adversaries sabotaging his violin before a high-profile performance, causing all strings but one to break during the concert. An undeterred Paganini continues to perform on three, two, and finally on a single string. In actuality, Paganini himself occasionally broke strings during his performances on purpose so he could further display his virtuosity.
[
31
]
He did this by carefully filing notches into them to weaken them, so that they would break when in use.

In
Don Nigro
's satirical comedy play
Paganini
(1995), the great violinist seeks vainly for his salvation, claiming that he unknowingly
sold his soul to the Devil
. "Variation upon variation," he cries at one point, "but which variation leads to salvation and which to damnation? Music is a question for which there is no answer." Paganini is portrayed as having killed three of his lovers and sinking repeatedly into poverty, prison, and drink. Each time he is "rescued" by the Devil, who appears in different guises, returning Paganini's violin so he can continue playing. In the end, Paganini's salvation—administered by a god-like Clockmaker—turns out to be imprisonment in a large bottle where he plays his music for the amusement of the public through all eternity. "Do not pity him, my dear," the Clockmaker tells Antonia, one of Paganini's murdered wives. "He is alone with the answer for which there is no question. The saved and the damned are the same."

The musical
CROSS ROAD ~The Devil's Violinist Paganini~
[
ja
]
, premiered 2022 and revived 2024, features Niccolo Paganini as a main character, played by
Hiroki Aiba
(2022 and 2024), Kenta Mizue (2022), and Kento Kinouchi (2024).
[
32
]
The story is about his making a contract with the Devil of Music,
Amduscias
, played by
Akinori Nakagawa
in both productions. The musical is by Bun-O Fujisawa, composed by Toshiyuki Muranaka. It was performed at Theater Creation in Tokyo, Japan, with a national tour in 2024.
[

Another musical about Paganini has been produced in South Korea, called
Paganini
. It focuses on his son, Achille.
