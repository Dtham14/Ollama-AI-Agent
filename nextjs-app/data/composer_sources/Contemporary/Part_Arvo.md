## Biography

Arvo Pärt
(
Estonian pronunciation:
[ˈɑrvo
ˈpært]
; born 11 September 1935) is an
Estonian
composer of
contemporary classical music
. Since the late 1970s, Pärt has worked in a
minimalist
style that employs
tintinnabuli
, a compositional technique he invented. Pärt's music is in part inspired by
Gregorian chant
. His most performed works include
Fratres
(1977),
Spiegel im Spiegel
(1978), and
Für Alina
(1976). From 2011 to 2018, and again in 2022, Pärt was the most performed living composer in the world, and the second most performed in 2019, after
John Williams
. The
Arvo Pärt Centre
, in
Laulasmaa
, was opened to the public in 2018.

Pärt was born in
Paide
,
Järva County
, Estonia, on 11 September 1935.
[

]
He was raised by his mother and stepfather in
Rakvere
in northern Estonia.
[
2
]
He began to experiment with the top and bottom notes of the family's piano as the middle register was damaged.
[

]

Pärt's musical education began at the age of seven when he began attending music school in Rakvere. By his early teenage years, Pärt was writing his own compositions. His first serious study came in 1954 at the Tallinn Music Middle School, but less than a year later he temporarily abandoned it to fulfill military service, playing
oboe
and percussion in the army band.
[
4
]
After his military service he attended the
Tallinn Conservatory
, where he studied composition with
Heino Eller
[
5
]
and it was said of him, "he just seemed to shake his sleeves and the notes would fall out".
[
6
]
During the 1950s, he also completed his first vocal composition, the
cantata
Meie aed
('Our Garden') for children's choir and orchestra. He graduated in 1963.

As a student, Pärt composed music for film and the stage, creating scores for over fifty movies. Although filmmaking and film music were not primary sources of inspiration for him, these compositions provided a medium for exploring serial and tonal techniques—an amalgamation that would later influence his collage works of the 1960s.
[
7
]
From 1957 to 1967, he worked as a sound producer for the Estonian public radio broadcaster
Eesti Rahvusringhääling
.

Tikhon Khrennikov
criticized Pärt in 1962 for employing
serialism
in
Nekrolog
(1960), the first 12-tone music written in Estonia,
[
8
]
which exhibited his "susceptibility to foreign influences". But nine months later Pärt won First Prize in a competition of 1,200 works, awarded by the all-
Union Society of Composers
, indicating the Soviet regime's inability to agree on what was permissible.
[
9
]
His first overtly sacred piece,
Credo
(1968), was a turning point in his career and life; on a personal level he had reached a creative crisis that led him to renounce the techniques and means of expression used so far; on a social level the religious nature of this piece resulted in him being unofficially censured and his music disappearing from concert halls. For the next eight years he composed very little, focusing instead on study of
medieval
and
Renaissance music
to find his new musical language. In 1972 he converted from
Lutheranism
to
Orthodox Christianity
.
[

]
[
11
]

Pärt reemerged as a composer in 1976 with music in his new compositional style and technique, tintinnabuli.
[
11
]

On 10 December 2011,
Pope Benedict XVI
appointed Pärt a member of the
Pontifical Council for Culture
for a five-year renewable term.
[
12
]

In 2014
The Daily Telegraph
described Pärt as possibly "the world's greatest living composer" and "by a long way, Estonia's most celebrated export". When asked how Estonian he felt his music to be, Pärt replied: "I don't know what is Estonian... I don't think about these things." Unlike many of his fellow Estonian composers, Pärt never found inspiration in the country's
national epic
,
Kalevipoeg
, even in his early works. Pärt said, "My
Kalevipoeg
is Jesus Christ."
[

]

Familiar works by Pärt are
Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten
for
string orchestra
and bell (1977) and the
string quintet
Fratres
I
(1977, revised 1983), which he transcribed for string orchestra and percussion, the solo violin "Fratres II" and the cello ensemble "Fratres III" (both 1980).

Pärt is often identified with the school of
minimalism
and, more specifically, that of mystic minimalism or
holy minimalism
.
[
13
]
He is considered a pioneer of the latter style, along with contemporaries
Henryk Górecki
and
John Tavener
.
[
14
]
Although his fame initially rested on instrumental works such as
Tabula Rasa
and
Spiegel im Spiegel
, his
choral
works have also come to be widely appreciated.

In this period of Estonian history, Pärt was unable to encounter many musical influences from outside the Soviet Union except for a few illegal tapes and scores. Although Estonia had been an independent state at the time of Pärt's birth, the
Soviet Union occupied it in 1940
as a result of the Soviet–
Nazi
Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact
; and the country would then remain under Soviet domination—except for the three-year period of German wartime occupation—for the next 51 years.

Pärt's works are generally divided into two periods. He composed his early works using a range of
neo-classical
styles influenced by
Shostakovich
,
Prokofiev
, and
Bartók
. He then began to compose using
Schoenberg's
twelve-tone technique
and serialism. This, however, not only earned the ire of the Soviet establishment but also proved to be a creative dead-end. When Soviet censors banned early works, Pärt entered the first of several periods of contemplative silence, during which he studied choral music from the 14th to 16th centuries.
[
5
]
In this context, Pärt's biographer,
Paul Hillier
, observed that "he had reached a position of complete despair in which the composition of music appeared to be the most futile of gestures, and he lacked the musical faith and willpower to write even a single note."
[
15
]

In his work
Credo
(1968), written for solo piano, orchestra, and chorus, he employed
avant-garde
techniques. This work differed in its forms and context from his earlier
atonal
and tintinnabula works. Inspired by 14th and 16th century liturgical music, he used a
poly-stylistic
compositional technique to express his faith in God while incorporating avant-garde techniques of the 20th century. By definition, a
credo
expresses beliefs and guides religious action, and in his work it represents his faith in God. The Soviets eventually banned the work due to its clear religious context, even though it incorporated avant-garde and a constructivist procedure.
[
16
]

The spirit of early European
polyphony
informed the composition of Pärt's transitional
Third Symphony (1971)
; after that, he immersed himself in early music, reinvestigating the roots of Western music. He studied
plainsong
,
Gregorian chant
, and the emergence of
polyphony
in the European
Renaissance
.

The music that began to emerge after this period was radically different. This period of new compositions included the 1977 works
Fratres
,
Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten
and
Tabula Rasa
.
[
5
]
Pärt describes the music of this period as "
tintinnabuli
"—like the ringing of bells.
Spiegel im Spiegel
(1978) is a well-known example used in many films. The music is characterised by simple
harmonies
, often single unadorned notes, or
triads
, which form the basis of Western harmony. These are reminiscent of ringing bells. Tintinnabuli works are rhythmically simple and do not change tempo. In this technique, each syllable of a word is assigned to a pitch and a duration. Once two or three words have been connected, a phrase has been made.
[
17
]
Another characteristic of Pärt's later works is that they are frequently settings for sacred texts, although he mostly chooses
Latin
or the
Church Slavonic language
used in Orthodox liturgy instead of his native
Estonian language
. Large-scale works inspired by religious texts include
Berliner Messe
,
St. John Passion
and
Te Deum
; the author of the famous text of
Litany
is the 4th-century theologian
John Chrysostom
.
[
18
]
Choral works from this period include
Magnificat
and
The Beatitudes
.
[
5
]
Though such works have obviously been intended as religious,
Andreas Dorschel
suggested that it is up for sociological scrutiny whether Pärt's music has lead its 20th and 21st century audiences into religion or, rather, has replaced religion for them.
[
19
]

Pärt was the most performed living composer in the world from 2011 to 2018, but then the second-most performed composer, after
John Williams
.
[
20
]
In 2022, Arvo was back to the top in Bachtrack. The two switched position again back and forth in 2023 and 2024.
[
21
]

Pärt's music came to public attention in the West largely thanks to
Manfred Eicher
who recorded several of Pärt's compositions for
ECM Records
starting in 1984.
[
23
]
Pärt wrote
Cecilia, vergine romana
on an Italian text about life and martyrdom of
Saint Cecilia
, the
patron saint
of music, for choir and orchestra on a commission for the
Great Jubilee
in Rome, where it was performed, close to her feast day on 22 November, by the
Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia
conducted by
Myung-whun Chung
.
[
24
]

Invited by
Walter Fink
, Pärt was the 15th composer featured in the annual
Komponistenporträt
of the
Rheingau Musik Festival
[
25
]
in 2005 in four concerts.
[
26
]
Chamber music included
Für Alina
for piano, played by himself,
Spiegel im Spiegel
and
Psalom
for string quartet. The chamber orchestra of the
Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra
played his
Trisagion
,
Fratres
and
Cantus
along with works of
J.S. Bach
. The
Windsbach Boys Choir
and soloists
Sibylla Rubens
,
Ingeborg Danz
,
Markus Schäfer
and
Klaus Mertens
performed
Magnificat
and
Collage über B-A-C-H
together with two
Bach cantatas
and one by
Mendelssohn
. The
Hilliard Ensemble
, organist
Christopher Bowers-Broadbent
, the
Rostock Motet Choir
and the Hilliard instrumental ensemble, conducted by
Markus Johannes Langer
[
de
]
, performed a program of Pärt's organ music and works for voices (some
a cappella
), including
Pari intervallo
,
De profundis
, and
Miserere
.
[
27
]
Pärt's composition,
Für Lennart
, written for the memory of the Estonian President,
Lennart Meri
, was played at Meri's funeral service on 26 March 2006.
[
28
]

In response to the
murder of the Russian investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya
in Moscow on 7 October 2006, Pärt declared that all of his works performed in 2006 and 2007 would be in honour of her death, issuing the following statement: "Anna Politkovskaya staked her entire talent, energy and—in the end—even her life on saving people who had become victims of the abuses prevailing in Russia."
[
29
]

Pärt was honoured as the featured composer of the 2008
Raidió Teilifís Éireann
Living Music Festival
[
30
]
in Dublin, Ireland. He was also commissioned by Louth Contemporary Music Society
[
31
]
to compose a new choral work based on "
Saint Patrick's Breastplate
", which premiered in 2008 in
County Louth
, Ireland. The new work,
The Deer's Cry
, is his first Irish commission, and received its debut in
Drogheda
and
Dundalk
in February 2008.
[
32
]

Pärt's 2008
Fourth Symphony is named
Los Angeles
and was dedicated to
Mikhail Khodorkovsky
. It was Pärt's first symphony written since his
Third Symphony
of 1971. It premiered in
Los Angeles
, California, at the
Walt Disney Concert Hall
on 10 January 2009,
[
33
]
and was nominated for a
Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition
in 2010.
[
34
]

On 26 January 2014,
Tõnu Kaljuste
, conducting the
Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir
, the Sinfonietta Riga, the
Tallinn Chamber Orchestra
, the
Latvian Radio Choir
and the Vox Clamantis ensemble, won a
Grammy for Best Choral Performance
for a performance of Pärt's
Adam's Lament
.
[
35
]
Describing aspects of Pärt's music as "
glocal
" in approach, Estonian musicologist Kerri Kotta noted that the composer "has been able to translate something very human into sound that crosses the borders normally separating people."
[
36
]

Pärt converted to Orthodox Christianity in 1972 upon marrying his second wife, Nora.
[
10
]

In 1980, after a prolonged struggle with Soviet officials, he was allowed to emigrate with his wife and their two sons. He lived first in
Vienna
, where he took Austrian citizenship, and then relocated to
Berlin
in 1981. He returned to Estonia around the turn of the 21st century and for a while lived alternately in Berlin
[
63
]
and
Tallinn
.
[
5
]
He now resides in
Laulasmaa
, about 35 kilometres (22 mi) from Tallinn.
[
64
]
He speaks fluent German as a result of living in German-speaking countries since 1980.
[
65

[
66

[
67
]

In 2010, the Pärt family established the
Arvo Pärt Centre
, an institution responsible for maintaining his personal archive, in the village of Laulasmaa. A new building of the centre opened to the visitors on 17 October 2018, containing a concert hall, a library, and research facilities. The centre also offers educational programmes for children and operates as an international information centre on Pärt's life and work.
[
68
]

In April 2020, although Pärt rarely gives interviews, he spoke to the Spanish newspaper
ABC
about the
COVID-19 pandemic
, stating that it was a "mega
fast
" and reminded him to follow the example of
John Updike
, who "once said that he tried to work with the same calm as the masters of the
Middle Ages
, who carved the church pews in places where it was impossible to see them".
[
69
]

On 11 September 2025 he celebrated his 90th birthday.
