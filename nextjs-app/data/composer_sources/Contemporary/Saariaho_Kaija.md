## Biography

Kaija Anneli Saariaho
(
Finnish:
[ˈkɑi̯jɑ
ˈsɑːriɑho]
;
née
Laakkonen
; 14 October 1952 – 2 June 2023) was a
Finnish
composer based in Paris, France. During the course of her career, Saariaho received commissions from the
Lincoln Center
for the
Kronos Quartet
and from
IRCAM
for the
Ensemble Intercontemporain
, the
BBC
, the
New York Philharmonic
, the
Salzburg Music Festival
, the
Théâtre du Châtelet
in Paris, and the
Finnish National Opera
, among others.

In a 2019 composers' poll by
BBC Music Magazine
, Saariaho was ranked the greatest living composer.

Saariaho studied composition in Helsinki,
Freiburg
, and Paris, where she also lived since 1982. Her research at the
Institute for Research and Coordination in Acoustics/Music (IRCAM)
marked a turning point in her music away from strict
serialism
towards
spectralism
. Her characteristically rich,
polyphonic
textures are often created by combining live music and electronics.

Saariaho was born in
Helsinki
, Finland. She played violin, guitar and piano growing up, and received her primary and secondary education at a Steiner school.

In university she studied first splitting her time between studying graphic design at the
Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture
, piano at the
Helsinki Conservatorium
[
fi
]
and musicology at the
University of Helsinki
; and then she later studied composition at the
Sibelius Academy
under the guidance of
Paavo Heininen
.
[

]
After attending the
Darmstadt Summer Courses
, she moved to Germany to study at the
Hochschule für Musik Freiburg
under
Brian Ferneyhough
and
Klaus Huber
. She found her Freiburg teachers' emphasis on
strict serialism
and mathematical structures stifling, saying in an interview:

In 1980, Saariaho went to the Darmstadt Summer Courses and attended a concert of the French
spectralists
Tristan Murail
and
Gérard Grisey
.
[

]
Hearing spectral music for the first time marked a profound shift in Saariaho's artistic direction. These experiences guided her decision to attend courses in
computer music
that were being given by
IRCAM
, the computer music research institute in Paris, by David Wessel,
Jean-Baptiste Barrière
[
de
;
fr
]
, and Marc Battier.

In 1982, she began work at IRCAM researching computer analyses of the sound-spectrum of individual notes produced by different instruments. She developed techniques for computer-assisted composition, experimented with
musique concrète
, and wrote her first pieces combining live performance with electronics. She also composed new works using IRCAM's CHANT synthesiser.
[

]
Each of her Jardin Secret trilogy was created with the use of computer programs.
Jardin secret I
(1985),
Jardin secret II
(1986), and
Nymphea (Jardin secret III)
(1987).
[

]
Her works with electronics were developed in collaboration with Jean-Baptiste Barrière, a composer, multimedia artist, and computer scientist who directed the IRCAM's department of musical research from 1984 to 1987. Saariaho and Barrière married in 1984. They have two children.

In Paris, Saariaho developed an emphasis on slow transformations of dense
masses of sound
.
[
9
]
Her first tape piece,
Vers Le Blanc
from 1982, and her orchestral and tape work,
Verblendungen
, are both constructed from a single transition: in
Vers Le Blanc
the transition is from one
pitch cluster
to another, while in
Verblendungen
, it is from loud to quiet.
Verblendungen
also uses a pair of visual ideas as its basis: a brush stroke which starts as a dense mark on the page and thins out into individual strands, and the word
Verblendungen
itself, which means "dazzlements, delusions, blindedness".
[

Her work in the 1980s and 1990s was marked by an emphasis on
timbre
and the use of
electronics
alongside traditional instruments.
Nymphéa (Jardin secret III)
(1987), for example, is for
string quartet
and live electronics and contains an additional vocal element: the musicians whisper the words of an
Arseny Tarkovsky
poem,
Now Summer is Gone
. In writing
Nymphea
, Saariaho used a
fractal
generator to create material. Writing about the compositional process, Saariaho said:

Saariaho often talked about having a kind of
synaesthesia
, one that involves all of the senses, saying:

Another example is
Six Japanese Gardens
(1994), a percussion piece accompanied by a prerecorded electronic layer of the Japanese nature, traditional instruments, and chanting of Buddhist monks. During her visit to Tokyo in 1993, she expanded her original percussion conception into a semi-
indeterminate
piece. It consists of six movements that each represent a garden composed of traditional Japanese architecture, by which she was inspired rhythmically. Especially in movement IV and V, she explored many possibilities of complex
polyrhythm
in liberated instrumentation. She said:

In her book on Saariaho, musicologist
Pirkko Moisala
[
fi
;
sv
]
writes about the indeterminate nature of this composition:

On 1 December 2016, the
Metropolitan Opera
gave its first performance of
L'Amour de loin
, the second opera by a female composer ever to be presented by the company (the first was performed more than a century earlier, in 1903).
[
14
]
The subsequent transmission of the opera to cinema on 10 December 2016 as part of the
Metropolitan Opera Live in HD
series marked the first opera by a female composer, and the first opera conducted by a female conductor (
Susanna Mälkki
), in the series. In 2002 the Santa Fe Opera presented
L'Amour de loin
. In 2008, the Santa Fe Opera also presented her opera
Adriana Mater
.

Saariaho was the patron of the
Helsinki Music Centre
organ project and endowed the construction of a new organ in the Helsinki Music Centre with one million euros.
[
15
]
She was also the chair of the International Kaija Saariaho Organ Composition Competition,
[
16
]
which selected in April 2023 eleven compositions.
[
17
]

Saariaho was diagnosed with
glioblastoma
in February 2021. She died in Paris on 2 June 2023, at age 70.
[
18
]

Her very last work,
HUSH
, a concerto for trumpet and orchestra, was given its world premiere on 24 August 2023 at the Helsinki Music Centre with
Verneri Pohjola
and the
Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra
conducted by
Susanna Mälkki
.
[
19
]
[
20
]
While the premiere was posthumous, Saariaho had been able to hear the work herself at a rehearsal in the spring of 2023. The piece is conceived as a response to Saariaho's own first concerto
Graal Théâtre
and based on a text by
Aleksi Barrière
,
[
21
]
Saariaho's son and librettist of some of her last works.
