ⓘ
; 16 November 1895 – 28 December 1963) was a German and American composer,
music theorist
, teacher,
violist
and conductor. He founded the
Amar Quartet
in 1921, touring extensively in Europe. As a composer, he became a major advocate of the
Neue Sachlichkeit
(New Objectivity) style of music in the 1920s, with compositions such as
Kammermusik
, including works with viola and
viola d'amore
as solo instruments in a neo-
Bachian
spirit. Other notable compositions include his song cycle
Das Marienleben
(1923), his oratorio
Das Unaufhörliche
(1931),
[

]
Der Schwanendreher
for viola and orchestra (1935), the opera
Mathis der Maler
(1938) and the symphony
Mathis der Maler
(1934), the
Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber
(1943), and the oratorio
When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd
(1946), a requiem based on
Walt Whitman's poem
. Hindemith and his wife emigrated to Switzerland and the United States ahead of World War II, after worsening difficulties with the
Nazi
German regime. In his later years, he conducted and recorded much of his own music.

Most of Hindemith's compositions are anchored by a
foundational tone
, and use
musical forms
and
counterpoint
and
cadences
typical of the Baroque and Classical traditions. His harmonic language is more modern, freely using all 12 notes of the
chromatic scale
within his tonal framework, as detailed in his three-volume treatise,
The Craft of Musical Composition
.

Paul Hindemith was born in
Hanau
, near
Frankfurt
, the eldest child of the painter and decorator Robert Hindemith from
Lower Silesia
and his wife Marie (née Warnecke).
[
2
]
He was taught the violin as a child. He entered Frankfurt's
Dr. Hoch's Konservatorium
, where he studied violin with
Adolf Rebner
, as well as conducting and composition with
Arnold Mendelssohn
and
Bernhard Sekles
. At first he supported himself by playing in dance bands and musical-comedy groups. He became deputy leader of the
Frankfurt Opera Orchestra
in 1914 and was promoted to
concertmaster
in 1916.
[
3
]
He played second violin in the
Rebner
String Quartet
from 1914.

After his father's 1915 death in
World War I
, Hindemith was conscripted into the
Imperial German Army
in September 1917 and sent to a regiment in
Alsace
in January 1918.
[
4
]
There he was assigned to play bass drum in the regiment band, and also formed a string quartet. In May 1918 he was deployed to the front in
Flanders
, where he served as a sentry; his diary has him "surviving grenade attacks only by good luck", according to
New Grove Dictionary
.
[
4
]
After the armistice he returned to Frankfurt and the Rebner Quartet.
[

]

In 1921, Hindemith founded the
Amar Quartet
, playing viola, and extensively toured Europe with an emphasis on contemporary music. His younger brother
Rudolf
was the original cellist.
[
5
]

As a composer, he became a major advocate of the
Neue Sachlichkeit
(New Objectivity) style of music in the 1920s, with compositions such as
Kammermusik
. Reminiscent of Bach's
Brandenburg Concertos
, they include works with viola and viola d'amore as solo instruments in a neo-Bachian spirit.
[
6
]
In 1922, some of his pieces were played in the
International Society for Contemporary Music
festival at
Salzburg
, which first brought him to the attention of an international audience. The next year, he composed the
song cycle
Das Marienleben
(
The Life of Mary
) and began to work as an organizer of the
Donaueschingen Festival
, where he programmed works by several
avant-garde
composers, including
Anton Webern
and
Arnold Schoenberg
. In 1927 he was appointed Professor at the
Berliner Hochschule für Musik
in Berlin.
[
7
]
Hindemith wrote the music for
Hans Richter
's 1928 avant-garde film
Ghosts Before Breakfast
(
Vormittagsspuk
) and also acted in the film; the score and original film were later
burned by the Nazis
.
[
8
]
In 1929, Hindemith played the solo part in the premiere of
William Walton
's
viola concerto
, after
Lionel Tertis
, for whom it was written, turned it down.

On 15 May 1924, Hindemith married the actress and singer Gertrud (Johanna Gertrude) Rottenberg (1900–1967).
[
2
]
The marriage was childless.
[
9
]

The
Nazis
' relationship to Hindemith's music was complicated. Some condemned his music as "
degenerate
" (largely based on his early, sexually charged operas such as
Sancta Susanna
). In December 1934, during a speech at the
Berlin Sports Palace
, Germany's Minister of Propaganda
Joseph Goebbels
publicly denounced Hindemith as an "atonal noisemaker".
[
10
]
The Nazis banned his music in October 1936, and he was subsequently included in the 1938
Entartete Musik
(Degenerate Music) exhibition in
Düsseldorf
.
[
11
]
Other officials working in
Nazi Germany
, though, thought that he might provide Germany with an example of a modern German composer, as, by this time, he was writing music based in tonality, with frequent references to folk music. The conductor
Wilhelm Furtwängler
's defence of Hindemith, published in 1934, takes this line.
[
12
]
The controversy around his work continued throughout the thirties, with Hindemith falling in and out of favour with the Nazis.

During the 1930s, Hindemith visited
Cairo
and also
Ankara
several times. He accepted an invitation from the Turkish government to oversee the creation of a music school in Ankara in 1935, after Goebbels had pressured him to request an indefinite leave of absence from the Berlin Academy.
[
11
]
In Turkey, he was the leading figure of a new music pedagogy in the era of president
Kemal Atatürk
. His deputy was
Eduard Zuckmayer
. Hindemith led the reorganization of Turkish music education and the early efforts to establish the
Turkish State Opera and Ballet
. He did not stay in Turkey as long as many other émigrés, but he greatly influenced Turkish musical life; the
Ankara State Conservatory
owes much to his efforts. Young Turkish musicians regarded Hindemith as a "real master", and he was appreciated and greatly respected.
[
10
]

Toward the end of the 1930s, Hindemith made several tours of America as a viola and
viola d'amore
soloist.

He emigrated to
Switzerland
in 1938, partly because his wife was of part-Jewish ancestry; "it was primarily Hindemith's conflict with the artistic policies of the Third Reich, however, that determined his decision to leave."
[
13
]

At the same time that he was codifying his musical language, Hindemith's teaching and compositions began to be affected by his theories, according to critics such as
Ernest Ansermet
.
[
14
]
Arriving in the U.S. in 1940, he taught primarily at
Yale University
,
[
15
]
where he founded the Yale Collegium Musicum.
[
6
]
At Yale, he required his students to study composition and theory from his pedagogical work,
The Craft of Musical Composition
, among other educational texts. Because of his commitments outside the university, the number of composers who studied under Hindemith was small. According to Luther Noss's
A History of the Yale School of Music 1855–1970
, Hindemith taught for a little over ten years, teaching 400 students, of whom 46 earned degrees, mostly in music theory.
[
16
]
He had such notable students as
Lukas Foss
,
Graham George
,
Andrew Hill
,
Norman Dello Joio
,
Mel Powell
,
Yehudi Wyner
,
Harold Shapero
,
Hans Otte
,
Ruth Schönthal
,
Samuel Adler
,
Frank Lewin
,
Leonard Sarason
, Fenno Heath,
Mitch Leigh
, and
George Roy Hill
. Hindemith also taught at the
University at Buffalo
,
Cornell University
, and
Wells College
.
[
17
]
During this time he gave the
Charles Eliot Norton Lectures
at
Harvard
, from which the book
A Composer's World
(1952) was extracted.
[
18
]
Hindemith had a long friendship with
Erich Katz
, whose compositions were influenced by him.
[
19
]
Also among Hindemith's students were the future rocket scientist
Wernher von Braun
[
20
]
and the composers
Franz Reizenstein
,
Harald Genzmer
,
Oskar Sala
,
Arnold Cooke
,
[
21
]
Robert Strassburg
,
[
22
]
and
dozens of other notables
.

Hindemith became a
U.S. citizen
in 1946, but returned to Europe in 1953, living in
Zürich
and teaching at the university there until he retired from teaching in 1957.
[
6
]
[
11
]
Toward the end of his life he began to conduct more and made numerous recordings, mostly of his own music.
[
11
]

In 1954, an anonymous critic for
Opera
magazine, having attended a performance of Hindemith's
Neues vom Tage
, wrote: "Mr Hindemith is no virtuoso conductor, but he does possess an extraordinary knack of making performers understand how his own music is supposed to go."
[
23
]

Hindemith received the
Wihuri Sibelius Prize
in 1955.
[
24
]
He was awarded the
Balzan Prize
in 1962 "for the wealth, extent and variety of his work, which is among the most valid in contemporary music, and which contains masterpieces of opera, symphonic and chamber music."
[
24
]
[
25
]

Despite a prolonged decline in his physical health, Hindemith composed almost until his death. He died in Frankfurt from
pancreatitis
, aged 68. He and his wife were buried in the cemetery in
La Chiésaz
,
Vaud
, Switzerland.
[
2
]

Hindemith is among the most significant German composers of his time. His early works are in a late
romantic
idiom, and he later produced
expressionist
works, rather in the style of the early
Schoenberg
, before developing a leaner,
contrapuntally
complex style in the 1920s. This style has been described as
neoclassical
,
[
26
]
but is quite different from the works by
Igor Stravinsky
labeled with that term, owing more to the contrapuntal language of
Johann Sebastian Bach
and
Max Reger
than the Classical clarity of
Mozart
.
[

The new style can be heard in the series of works called
Kammermusik
(Chamber Music) from 1922 to 1927. Each of these pieces is written for a different small instrumental ensemble, many of them very unusual.
Kammermusik No. 6
, for example, is a concerto for the
viola d'amore
, an instrument that has not been in wide use since the
baroque
period, but which Hindemith himself played. He continued to write for unusual groups of instruments throughout his life, producing (for example) a trio for viola,
heckelphone
and piano (1928), seven trios for three
trautoniums
(1930), a
sonata
for double bass, and a concerto for trumpet, bassoon, and strings (both in 1949).

In the 1930s Hindemith began to write less for
chamber music
groups, and more for large orchestral forces. He wrote his opera
Mathis der Maler
, based on the life of the painter
Matthias Grünewald
, in 1933–1935. This opera is rarely staged, though a well-known production by the
New York City Opera
in 1995 was an exception.
[
27
]
In 2021,
Naxos
released a 2012
Theater an der Wien
production on DVD.
[
28
]
The opera combines the neoclassicism of Hindemith's earlier works with
folk song
. As a preliminary stage of composing the opera, Hindemith wrote a purely instrumental
symphony
also called
Mathis der Maler
, which is one of his most frequently performed works. In the opera, some portions of the symphony appear as instrumental interludes; others are elaborated in vocal scenes.

Hindemith wrote
Gebrauchsmusik
(Music for Use)—compositions intended to have a social or political purpose and sometimes written to be played by amateurs. The concept was inspired by
Bertolt Brecht
. An example of this is Hindemith's
Trauermusik
(Funeral Music), written in January 1936. He was preparing the London premiere of his viola concerto
Der Schwanendreher
when he heard news of the death of
George V
. He quickly wrote
Trauermusik
for solo viola and string orchestra in tribute to the late king, and the premiere was given that same evening, the day after the king's death.
[
29
]
Other examples of Hindemith's
Gebrauchsmusik
include:

Hindemith's most popular work, both on record and in the concert hall, is probably the
Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber
, written in 1943. It takes
melodies
from various works by
Carl Maria von Weber
, mainly piano duets, but also one from the overture to his
incidental music
for
Turandot
(Op. 37/J. 75), and transforms and adapts them so that each movement of the piece is based on one theme.

In 1951, Hindemith completed his
Symphony in B-flat
. Scored for
concert band
, it was written for the
U.S. Army Band "Pershing's Own"
. Hindemith premiered it with that band on 5 April of that year.
[
30
]
Its second performance took place under the baton of Hugh McMillan, conducting the Boulder Symphonic Band at the University of Colorado. The piece is representative of Hindemith's late works, exhibiting strong contrapuntal lines throughout, and is a cornerstone of the band repertoire. He recorded it in stereo with members of the
Philharmonia Orchestra
for
EMI
in 1956.

Most of Hindemith's music employs a unique system that is tonal but non-
diatonic
, often notated without a traditional
key signature
. Like most tonal music, it is centred on a tonic and modulates from one tonal centre to another, but it "attempts ... the free use of all the twelve tones of the
chromatic scale
",
[
31
]
rather than relying on a
diatonic scale
as a restricted subset of these notes. He even rewrote some of his music after developing this system. One of the core features of Hindemith's system is a ranking of all musical
intervals
of the 12-tone equally tempered scale, from the most
consonant
to the most
dissonant
. He classifies chords in six categories, on the basis of dissonance, whether they contain a tritone, and whether they clearly suggest a root or tonal centre. His philosophy also encompassed melody—he strove for melodies that do not clearly outline major or minor triads.
[
32
]

In the late 1930s Hindemith wrote an instructional treatise in three volumes,
The Craft of Musical Composition
, which lays out this system in great detail. He also advocated this system as a means of understanding and analyzing the harmonic structure of other music, claiming that it has a broader reach than the traditional
Roman numeral
approach to chords (an approach strongly tied to diatonic scales). In the final chapter of Book 1, Hindemith seeks to illustrate the wide-ranging relevance and applicability of his system, analyzing musical examples from the medieval to the contemporary. These analyses include the early Gregorian melody
Dies irae
, compositions by
Guillaume de Machaut
,
J. S. Bach
,
Richard Wagner
,
Igor Stravinsky
,
Arnold Schoenberg
, and a composition of his own.
[
33
]

Hindemith's 1942 piano work
Ludus Tonalis
contains twelve
fugues
, in the manner of
Johann Sebastian Bach
, using traditional devices like inversion, diminution, augmentation, retrogradation, stretto, etc. Each fugue is connected by an
interlude
to the next, during which the music moves from the
key
of the last to its successor. The order of the keys follows Hindemith's ranking of musical intervals around the tonal center of C.
[
34
]

Another traditional aspect of classical music that Hindemith retains is the idea of dissonance resolving to consonance. Much of Hindemith's music begins in consonant territory, progresses into dissonant tension, and resolves in full, consonant chords and
cadences
.
[
35
]
This is especially apparent in his
Concert Music for Strings and Brass
(1930).

Hindemith's complete set of instructional books, in possible educational order:

Hindemith was a prolific composer.
[
43
]
He conducted some of his own music in a series of recordings for
EMI
with the
Philharmonia Orchestra
and for
Deutsche Grammophon
with the
Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra
, which have been digitally remastered and released on CD.
[
44
]
[
45

The Violin Concerto was also recorded by
Decca/London
, with the composer conducting the
London Symphony Orchestra
and
David Oistrakh
as soloist.
Everest Records
issued a recording of Hindemith's postwar
When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd
("A Requiem for Those We Love") on LP, conducted by Hindemith. A stereo recording of Hindemith conducting the requiem with the
New York Philharmonic Orchestra
, with Louise Parker and
George London
as soloists, was made for
Columbia Records
in 1963 and later issued on CD. He also appeared on television as a guest conductor of the
Chicago Symphony Orchestra
's nationally syndicated "Music from Chicago" series; the performances have been released by
VAI
on home video. A complete collection of Hindemith's orchestral music was recorded by German and Australian orchestras, all conducted by
Werner Andreas Albert
and released on the
CPO
label.

An annual festival of Hindemith's music has been held at
William Paterson University
in Wayne, New Jersey, from 2003 through at least 2017. It features student, staff, and professional musicians performing a range of Hindemith's works.
