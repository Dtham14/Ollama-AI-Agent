French:
[ɔlivje
øʒɛn
pʁɔspɛʁ
ʃaʁl
mɛsjɑ̃]
; 10 December 1908 – 27 April 1992) was a French composer, organist, and
ornithologist
. One of the major composers of the
20th century
, he was also an outstanding teacher of composition and musical analysis.

Messiaen entered the
Conservatoire de Paris
at age 11 and studied with
Paul Dukas
,
Maurice Emmanuel
,
Charles-Marie Widor
and
Marcel Dupré
, among others. He was appointed organist at the
Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris
, in 1931, a post he held for 61 years, until his death. He taught at the
Schola Cantorum de Paris
during the 1930s. After the
fall of France
in 1940, Messiaen was interned for nine months in the German prisoner of war camp
Stalag VIII-A
, where he composed his
Quatuor pour la fin du temps
(
Quartet for the End of Time
) for the four instruments available in the prison—piano, violin, cello and clarinet. The piece was first performed by Messiaen and fellow prisoners for an audience of inmates and prison guards.
[

]
Soon after his release in 1941, Messiaen was appointed professor of harmony at the Paris Conservatoire. In 1966, he was appointed professor of composition there, and he held both positions until retiring in 1978. His
many distinguished pupils
included
Iannis Xenakis
,
George Benjamin
,
Alexander Goehr
,
Pierre Boulez
,
Jacques Hétu
,
Tristan Murail
,
Karlheinz Stockhausen
,
György Kurtág
, and
Yvonne Loriod
, who became his second wife.

Messiaen perceived colours when he heard certain
musical chords
(a phenomenon known as
chromesthesia
); according to him, combinations of these colours were important in his compositional process. He travelled widely and wrote works inspired by diverse influences, including
Japanese music
, the landscape of
Bryce Canyon
in Utah, and the life of
St. Francis of Assisi
. His style absorbed many global musical influences, such as Indonesian
gamelan
(tuned percussion often features prominently in his orchestral works). He found
birdsong
fascinating, notating bird songs worldwide and incorporating birdsong
transcriptions
into his music.

Messiaen's music is
rhythmically
complex.
Harmonically
and
melodically
, he employed a system he called
modes of limited transposition
, which he abstracted from the systems of material his early compositions and improvisations generated. He wrote music for chamber ensembles and orchestra, voice, solo organ, and piano, and experimented with the use of novel electronic instruments developed in Europe during his lifetime. For a short period he experimented with the
parametrisation
associated with "total serialism", in which field he is often cited as an innovator. His innovative use of colour, his conception of the relationship between time and music, and his use of birdsong are among the features that make Messiaen's music distinctive.

Olivier Eugène Prosper Charles Messiaen
[
6
]
was born on 10 December 1908 at 20 Boulevard Sixte-Isnard in
Avignon
, France, into a literary family.
[
7
]
He was the elder of two sons of
Cécile Anne Marie Antoinette Sauvage
, a poet, and
Pierre Léon Joseph Messiaen
[
es
;
fr
]
, a scholar and teacher of English from a farm near
Wervicq-Sud
[
8
]
who also translated
William Shakespeare
's plays into French.
[
9
]
Messiaen's mother published a sequence of poems,
L'âme en bourgeon
(
The Budding Soul
), the last chapter of
Tandis que la terre tourne
(
As the Earth Turns
), which address her unborn son. Messiaen later said this sequence of poems influenced him deeply and cited it as prophetic of his future artistic career.
[
10
]
His brother
Alain André Prosper Messiaen
[
fr
]
, four years his junior, became a poet.

At the outbreak of
World War I
, Pierre enlisted and Cécile took their two boys to live with her brother in
Grenoble
. There Messiaen became fascinated with drama, reciting Shakespeare to his brother. Their homemade toy theatre had translucent backdrops made of cellophane wrappers.
[
11
]
At this time he also adopted the
Roman Catholic
faith. Later, Messiaen felt most at home in the Alps of the
Dauphiné
, where he had a house built south of Grenoble. He composed most of his music there.
[
12
]

Messiaen took piano lessons, having already taught himself to play. His interests included the recent music of French composers
Claude Debussy
and
Maurice Ravel
, and he asked for opera vocal scores for Christmas presents.
[
13
]
He also saved to buy scores, including
Edvard Grieg
's
Peer Gynt
, whose "beautiful Norwegian melodic lines with the taste of folk song ... gave me a love of melody".
[
14
]
Around this time he began to compose.

In 1918 his father returned from the war and the family moved to
Nantes
. Messiaen continued music lessons; one of his teachers, Jehan de Gibon, gave him a score of Debussy's opera
Pelléas et Mélisande
, which Messiaen called "a thunderbolt" and "probably the most decisive influence on me".
[
15
]
The next year, his father gained a teaching post at
Sorbonne University
in Paris. Olivier entered the
Paris Conservatoire
in 1919, aged 11.
[
16
]

Messiaen made excellent academic progress at the Conservatoire. In 1924, aged 15, he was awarded second prize in
harmony
, having been taught in that subject by professor
Jean Gallon
. In 1925, he won first prize in piano
accompaniment
, and in 1926 he gained first prize in
fugue
. After studying with
Maurice Emmanuel
, he was awarded second prize for the history of music in 1928.
[
17
]
Emmanuel's example engendered an interest in ancient Greek rhythms and exotic modes.
[
18
]
After showing improvisational skills on the piano, Messiaen studied organ with
Marcel Dupré
.
[
19
]
He won first prize in organ playing and improvisation in 1929.
[
18
]
After a year studying composition with
Charles-Marie Widor
, in autumn 1927 he entered the class of the newly appointed
Paul Dukas
. Messiaen's mother died of tuberculosis shortly before the class began.
[
20
]
Despite his grief, he resumed his studies, and in 1930 Messiaen won first prize in composition.
[
18
]

While a student he composed his first published works—his eight
Préludes
for piano (the earlier
Le banquet céleste
was published subsequently). These exhibit Messiaen's use of his modes of limited transposition and
palindromic
rhythms (Messiaen called these
non-retrogradable rhythms
). His official début came in 1931 with his orchestral suite
Les offrandes oubliées
. That year he first heard a
gamelan
group, sparking his interest in the use of tuned percussion.
[
21
]

In the autumn of 1927, Messiaen joined Dupré's organ course. Dupré later wrote that Messiaen, having never seen an organ console, sat quietly for an hour while Dupré explained and demonstrated the instrument, and then came back a week later to play
Johann Sebastian Bach
's
Fantasia in C minor
to an impressive standard.
[
22
]
From 1929, Messiaen regularly deputised at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité for the ailing
Charles Quef
. The post became vacant in 1931 when Quef died, and Dupré,
Charles Tournemire
and Widor among others supported Messiaen's candidacy. His formal application included a letter of recommendation from Widor. The appointment was confirmed in 1931,
[
23
]
and he remained the organist at the church for more than 60 years.
[
24
]
He also assumed a post at the Schola Cantorum de Paris in the early 1930s.
[
25
]
In 1932, he composed the
Apparition de l'église éternelle
for organ.
[
26
]

He also married the violinist and composer
Claire Delbos
(daughter of
Victor Delbos
) that year. Their marriage inspired him both to compose works for her to play (
Thème et variations
for violin and piano in the year they were married) and to write pieces to celebrate their domestic happiness, including the song cycle
Poèmes pour Mi
in 1936, which he orchestrated in 1937.
Mi
was Messiaen's affectionate nickname for his wife.
[
27
]
On 14 July 1937, the Messiaens' son, Pascal Emmanuel, was born; Messiaen celebrated the occasion by writing
Chants de Terre et de Ciel
.
[
28
]
The marriage turned tragic when Delbos lost her memory after an operation toward the end of World War II. She spent the rest of her life in mental institutions.
[
29
]

During this period he composed several multi-movement organ works. He arranged his orchestral suite
L'Ascension
for organ, replacing the orchestral version's third movement with an entirely new movement,
Transports de joie d'une âme devant la gloire du Christ qui est la sienne
(
Ecstasies of a soul before the glory of Christ which is the soul's own
).
[
30
]
He also wrote the extensive cycles
La Nativité du Seigneur
(
The Nativity of the Lord
) and
Les Corps glorieux
(
The glorious bodies
).
[
31
]

In 1936, along with
André Jolivet
,
Daniel Lesur
and
Yves Baudrier
, Messiaen formed the group
La jeune France
("Young France"). Their manifesto implicitly attacked the frivolity predominant in contemporary Parisian music and rejected
Jean Cocteau
's 1918
Le coq et l'arlequin
in favour of a "living music, having the impetus of sincerity, generosity and artistic conscientiousness".
[
32
]
Messiaen's career soon departed from this polemical phase.

In response to a commission for a piece to accompany light-and-water shows on
the Seine
during the
Paris Exposition
, in 1937 Messiaen demonstrated his interest in using the
ondes Martenot
, an electronic instrument, by composing
Fête des belles eaux
for an ensemble of six.
[
33
]
He included a part for the instrument in several of his subsequent compositions.
[
34
]

At the outbreak of World War II, Messiaen was drafted into the French army. Due to poor eyesight, he was enlisted as a medical auxiliary rather than an active combatant.
[
35
]
He was captured at
Verdun
, where he befriended clarinettist
Henri Akoka
; they were taken to
Görlitz
in May 1940, and imprisoned at
Stalag VIII-A
. He met a cellist (
Étienne Pasquier
) and a violinist (
Jean le Boulaire
[
fr
]
) among his fellow prisoners. He wrote a trio for them, which he gradually incorporated into a more expansive new work,
Quatuor pour la fin du Temps
("Quartet for the End of Time").
[
5
]
With the help of a friendly German guard,
Carl-Albert Brüll
[
de
;
es
]
, he acquired manuscript paper and pencils.
[
36
]
The work was first performed in January 1941 to an audience of prisoners and prison guards, with the composer playing a poorly maintained upright piano in freezing conditions and the trio playing third-hand unkempt instruments.
[
37
]
The enforced introspection and reflection of camp life bore fruit in one of 20th-century classical music's acknowledged masterpieces. The title's "end of time" alludes to the
Apocalypse
, and also to the way that Messiaen, through rhythm and harmony, used time in a manner completely different from his predecessors and contemporaries.
[
38
]

The idea of a European Centre of Education and Culture "Meeting Point Music Messiaen" on the site of Stalag VIII-A, for children and youth, artists, musicians and everyone in the region emerged in December 2004, was developed with the involvement of Messiaen's widow as a joint project between the council districts in Germany and Poland, and was completed in 2014.
[
39
]

Shortly after his release from Görlitz in May 1941 in large part due to the persuasions of his friend and teacher
Marcel Dupré
, Messiaen, who was now a household name, was appointed a professor of harmony at the Paris Conservatoire, where he taught until retiring in 1978.
[
40
]
He compiled his
Technique de mon langage musical
("Technique of my musical language") published in 1944, in which he quotes many examples from his music, particularly the
Quartet
.
[
41
]
Although only in his mid-thirties, his students described him as an outstanding teacher.
[
42
]
Among his early students were the composers
Pierre Boulez
and
Karel Goeyvaerts
. Other pupils included
Karlheinz Stockhausen
in 1952,
Alexander Goehr
in 1956–57,
Jacques Hétu
in 1962-63,
Tristan Murail
in 1967–72 and
George Benjamin
during the late 1970s.
[
43
]
The Greek composer Iannis Xenakis was referred to him in 1951; Messiaen urged Xenakis to take advantage of his background in mathematics and architecture in his music.
[
44
]

In 1943, Messiaen wrote
Visions de l'Amen
("Visions of the Amen") for two pianos for
Yvonne Loriod
and himself to perform. Shortly thereafter he composed the enormous solo piano cycle
Vingt regards sur l'enfant-Jésus
("Twenty gazes upon the child Jesus") for her.
[
45
]
Again for Loriod, he wrote
Trois petites liturgies de la présence divine
("Three small liturgies of the Divine Presence") for female chorus and orchestra, which includes a difficult solo piano part.
[
46
]

Two years after
Visions de l'Amen
, Messiaen composed the song cycle
Harawi
, the first of three works inspired by the legend of
Tristan
and
Isolde
. The second of these works about human (as opposed to divine) love was the result of a commission from
Serge Koussevitzky
. Messiaen said the commission did not specify the length of the work or the size of the orchestra. This was the ten-movement
Turangalîla-Symphonie
. It is not a conventional
symphony
, but rather an extended meditation on the joy of human union and love. It does not contain the sexual guilt inherent in
Richard Wagner
's
Tristan und Isolde
because Messiaen believed sexual love to be a divine gift.
[
35
]
The third piece inspired by the
Tristan
myth was
Cinq rechants
for 12 unaccompanied singers, described by Messiaen as influenced by the
alba
of the
troubadours
.
[
47
]
Messiaen visited the United States in 1949, where his music was conducted by Koussevitsky and
Leopold Stokowski
. His
Turangalîla-Symphonie
was first performed in the US the same year, conducted by
Leonard Bernstein
.
[
48
]

Messiaen taught an
analysis
class at the Paris Conservatoire. In 1947 he taught (and performed with Loriod) for two weeks in
Budapest
.
[
49
]
In 1949 he taught at
Tanglewood
[
50
]
and presented his work at the
Darmstadt new music summer school
.
[
51
]
While he did not employ the
twelve-tone technique
, after three years teaching analysis of twelve-tone scores, including works by
Arnold Schoenberg
, he experimented with ways of making scales of other elements (including duration, articulation and dynamics) analogous to the
chromatic pitch scale
. The results of these innovations was the "Mode de valeurs et d'intensités" for piano (from the
Quatre études de rythme
)
[
52
]
which has been misleadingly described as the first work of "
total serialism
". It had a large influence on the earliest European serial composers, including Boulez and Stockhausen.
[
53
]
During this period he also experimented with
musique concrète
, music for recorded sounds.
[
54
]

When in 1952 Messiaen was asked to provide a test piece for flautists at the Paris Conservatoire, he composed the piece
Le Merle noir
for flute and piano. While he had long been fascinated by birdsong, and birds had made appearances in several of his earlier works (for example
La Nativité
,
Quatuor
and
Vingt regards
), the flute piece was based entirely on the song of the
blackbird
.
[
55
]

He took this development to a new level with his 1953 orchestral work
Réveil des oiseaux
—its material consists almost entirely of the birdsong one might hear between midnight and noon in the
Jura
.
[
56
]
From this period onward, Messiaen incorporated birdsong into his compositions and composed several works for which birds provide both the title and subject matter (for example the collection of 13 piano pieces
Catalogue d'oiseaux
completed in 1958, and
La fauvette des jardins
of 1971).
[
57
]
Paul Griffiths
observed that Messiaen was a more conscientious ornithologist than any previous composer, and a more musical observer of birdsong than any previous ornithologist.
[
58
]

Messiaen's first wife died in 1959 after a long illness, and in 1961 he married Loriod.
[
59
]
He began to travel widely, to attend musical events and to seek out and transcribe the songs of more exotic birds in the wild. Despite this, he spoke only French. Loriod frequently assisted her husband's detailed studies of birdsong while walking with him, by making tape recordings for later reference.
[
60
]
In 1962 he visited Japan, where
Gagaku
music and
Noh
theatre inspired the orchestral "Japanese sketches",
Sept haïkaï
, which contain stylised imitations of traditional Japanese instruments.
[
61
]

Messiaen's music was by this time championed by, among others, Boulez, who programmed first performances at his
Domaine musical
concerts and the
Donaueschingen
festival.
[
62
]
Works performed included
Réveil des oiseaux
,
Chronochromie
(commissioned for the 1960 festival), and
Couleurs de la cité céleste
. The latter piece was the result of a commission for a composition for three trombones and three
xylophones
; Messiaen added to this more brass, wind, percussion and piano, and specified a xylophone,
xylorimba
and
marimba
rather than three xylophones.
[
63
]
Another work of this period,
Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum
, was commissioned as a commemoration of the dead of the two World Wars and was performed first semi-privately in the
Sainte-Chapelle
, then publicly in
Chartres Cathedral
with
Charles de Gaulle
in the audience.
[
64
]

His reputation as a composer continued to grow and in 1959, he was nominated as an
Officier
of the
Légion d'honneur
.
[
65
]
In 1966, he was officially appointed professor of composition at the Paris Conservatoire, although he had in effect been teaching composition for years.
[
66
]
Further honours included election to the
Institut de France
in 1967 and the
Académie des Beaux-arts
in 1968, the
Erasmus Prize
in 1971, the award of the
Royal Philharmonic Society
Gold Medal and the
Ernst von Siemens Music Prize
in 1975, the
Sonning Award
(Denmark's highest musical honour) in 1977, the
Wolf Prize in Arts
in 1982, and the presentation of the
Croix de Commander
of the Belgian
Order of the Crown
in 1980.
[
67
]

Messiaen's next work was the large-scale
La Transfiguration de Notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ
. The composition occupied him from 1965 to 1969 and the musicians employed include a 100-voice ten-part choir, seven solo instruments and large orchestra. Its fourteen movements are a meditation on the story of Christ's
Transfiguration
.
[
68
]
Shortly after its completion, Messiaen received a commission from
Alice Tully
for a work to celebrate the
U.S. bicentennial
. He arranged a visit to the U.S. in spring 1972, and was inspired by
Bryce Canyon
in
Utah
, where he observed the canyon's distinctive colours and birdsong.
[
69
]
The 12-movement orchestral piece
Des canyons aux étoiles...
was the result, first performed in 1974 in New York.
[
70
]

In 1971, he was asked to compose a piece for the
Paris Opéra
. Reluctant to take on such a major project, he was persuaded by French president
Georges Pompidou
to accept the commission and began work on
Saint-François d'Assise
in 1975 after two years of preparation. The composition was intensive (he also wrote his own
libretto
) and occupied him from 1975 to 1979; the orchestration was carried out from 1979 until 1983.
[
71
]
Messiaen preferred to describe the final work as a "spectacle" rather than an opera. It was first performed in 1983. Some commentators at the time thought that the opera would be his valediction (at times Messiaen himself believed so),
[
72
]
but he continued to compose. In 1984, he published a major collection of organ pieces,
Livre du Saint Sacrement
; other works include birdsong pieces for solo piano, and works for piano with orchestra.
[
73
]

In the summer of 1978, Messiaen was forced to retire from teaching at the Paris Conservatoire due to French law. He was promoted to the highest rank of the
Légion d'honneur
, the
Grand-Croix
, in 1987, and was awarded the decoration in London by his old friend
Jean Langlais
.
[
74
]
An operation prevented his participation in the celebration of his 70th birthday in 1978,
[
75
]
but in 1988 tributes for Messiaen's 80th included a complete performance in London's
Royal Festival Hall
of
St. François
, which the composer attended,
[
76
]
and
Erato
's publication of a 17-CD collection of his music, including a disc of Messiaen in conversation with
Claude Samuel
.
[
77
]

Although in considerable pain near the end of his life (requiring repeated surgery on his back),
[
78
]
he was able to fulfil a commission from the New York Philharmonic Orchestra,
Éclairs sur l'au-delà...
, which premièred six months after his death. He died in the
Beaujon Hospital
in
Clichy
on 27 April 1992, aged 83.
[
79
]

On going through his papers, Loriod discovered that, in the last months of his life, he had been composing a
concerto
for four musicians he felt particularly grateful to: herself, the cellist
Mstislav Rostropovich
, the
oboist
Heinz Holliger
and the flautist Catherine Cantin
[
80
]
(hence the title
Concert à quatre
). Four of the five intended movements were substantially complete; Loriod undertook the orchestration of the second half of the first movement and of the whole of the fourth with advice from George Benjamin. It was premiered by the dedicatees in September 1994.
[
81
]

Messiaen's music has been described as outside the western musical tradition, although growing out of that tradition and being influenced by it.
[
82
]
Much of his output denies the western conventions of forward motion,
development
and
diatonic
harmonic resolution. This is partly due to the symmetries of his technique—for instance the modes of limited transposition do not admit the conventional
cadences
found in western classical music.
[
83
]

"[Messiaen's youthful] fascination with Shakespeare's depiction of human passion and with his magical world also influenced the composer's later works."
[
84
]
Messiaen was not interested in depicting aspects of theology such as
sin
;
[
85
]
rather he concentrated on the theology of joy,
divine love
and
redemption
.
[
86
]

Messiaen continually evolved new composition techniques, always integrating them into his existing musical style; his final works still retain the use of modes of limited transposition.
[
83
]
For many commentators this continual development made every
major
work from the
Quatuor
onwards a conscious summation of all that Messiaen had composed up to that time. But very few of these works lack new technical ideas—simple examples being the introduction of communicable language in
Meditations
, the invention of a new percussion instrument (the
geophone
) for
Des canyons aux etoiles...
, and the freedom from any synchronisation with the main pulse of individual parts in certain birdsong episodes of
St. François d'Assise
.
[
87
]

As well as discovering new techniques, Messiaen studied and absorbed foreign music, including Ancient Greek rhythms,
[
18
]
Hindu
rhythms (he encountered
Śārṅgadeva
's list of 120
rhythmic units
, the deçî-tâlas),
[
88
]
Balinese and Javanese Gamelan, birdsong, and Japanese music (see
Example 1
for an instance of his use of ancient Greek and Hindu rhythms).
[
89
]

While he was instrumental in the academic exploration of his techniques (he compiled two treatises; the second, in five volumes, was substantially complete when he died and was published posthumously), and was a master of music analysis, he considered the development and study of techniques a means to intellectual, aesthetic, and emotional ends. Thus Messiaen maintained that a musical composition must be measured against three separate criteria: it must be interesting, beautiful to listen to, and touch the listener.
[
90
]

Messiaen wrote a large body of music for the piano. Although a considerable pianist himself, he was undoubtedly assisted by Loriod's formidable technique and ability to convey complex rhythms and rhythmic combinations; in his piano writing from
Visions de l'Amen
onward he had her in mind. Messiaen said, "I am able to allow myself the greatest eccentricities because to her anything is possible."
[
91
]

Developments in modern French music were a major influence on Messiaen, particularly the music of Debussy and his use of the
whole-tone scale
(which Messiaen called
Mode 1
in his modes of limited transposition). Messiaen rarely used the whole-tone scale in his compositions because, he said, after Debussy and Dukas there was "nothing to add",
[
92
]
but the modes he did use are similarly symmetrical.

Messiaen had a great admiration for the music of
Igor Stravinsky
, particularly the use of rhythm in earlier works such as
The Rite of Spring
, and his use of orchestral colour. He was further influenced by the orchestral brilliance of
Heitor Villa-Lobos
, who lived in Paris in the 1920s and gave acclaimed concerts there. Among composers for the keyboard, Messiaen singled out
Jean-Philippe Rameau
,
Domenico Scarlatti
,
Frédéric Chopin
, Debussy, and
Isaac Albéniz
.
[
91
]
He loved the music of
Modest Mussorgsky
and incorporated varied modifications of what he called the "M-shaped" melodic motif from Mussorgsky's
Boris Godunov
,
[
92
]
although he modified the final interval from a
perfect fourth
to a
tritone
(
Example 3
).
[
93
]

Messiaen was further influenced by
Surrealism
, as seen in the titles of some of the piano
Préludes
(
Un reflet dans le vent...
, "A reflection in the wind")
[

and in some of the imagery of his poetry (he published poems as prefaces to certain works, for example
Les offrandes oubliées
).
[

Colour lies at the heart of Messiaen's music. He believed that terms such as "
tonal
", "
modal
" and "
serial
" are misleading analytical conveniences.
[
96
]
For him there were no modal, tonal or serial compositions, only music with or without colour.
[
97
]
He said that
Monteverdi
,
Mozart
,
Chopin
,
Wagner
,
Mussorgsky
, and
Stravinsky
all wrote strongly coloured music.
[
98
]

In some of Messiaen's scores, he notated the colours in the music (notably in
Couleurs de la cité céleste
and
Des canyons aux étoiles...
)—the purpose being to aid the conductor in interpretation rather than to specify which colours the listener should experience. The importance of colour is linked to Messiaen's
synaesthesia
, which caused him to experience colours when he heard or imagined music (his form of synaesthesia, the most common form, involved experiencing the associated colours in a non-visual form rather than perceiving them visually). In his multi-volume music theory treatise
Traité de rythme, de couleur, et d'ornithologie
("Treatise of Rhythm, Colour and Birdsong"), Messiaen wrote descriptions of the colours of certain chords. His descriptions range from the simple ("gold and brown") to the highly detailed ("blue-violet rocks, speckled with little grey cubes,
cobalt blue
, deep
Prussian blue
, highlighted by a bit of violet-purple, gold, red, ruby, and stars of mauve, black and white. Blue-violet is dominant").

When asked what Messiaen's main influence had been on composers, George Benjamin said, "I think the sheer ... colour has been so influential, ... rather than being a decorative element, [Messiaen showed that colour] could be a structural, a fundamental element, ... the fundamental material of the music itself."
[
101
]

Many of Messiaen's composition techniques made use of symmetries of time and
pitch
.
[
102
]

From his earliest works, Messiaen used non-retrogradable (palindromic) rhythms (
Example 2
). He sometimes combined rhythms with harmonic sequences in such a way that, if the process were repeated indefinitely, the music would eventually run through all possible permutations and return to its starting point. For Messiaen, this represented the "charm of impossibilities" of these processes. He only ever presented a portion of any such process, as if allowing the informed listener a glimpse of something eternal. In the first movement of
Quatuor pour la fin du temps
the piano and cello together provide an early example.
[
103
]

Messiaen used modes he called
modes of limited transposition
.
[
83
]
They are distinguished as groups of notes that can only be
transposed
by a semitone a limited number of times. For example, the whole-tone scale (Messiaen's Mode 1) exists in only two transpositions: C–D–E–F
♯
–G
♯
–A
♯
and D
♭
–E
♭
–F–G–A–B. Messiaen abstracted these modes from the harmony of his improvisations and early works.
[
104
]
Music written using the modes avoids conventional diatonic harmonic progressions, since for example Messiaen's Mode 2 (identical to the
octatonic scale
used by other composers) permits precisely the
dominant seventh
chords whose tonic the mode does not contain.
[
105
]

As well as making use of non-retrogradable rhythms and the Hindu decî-tâlas, Messiaen also composed with "additive" rhythms. This involves lengthening individual notes slightly or interpolating a short note into an otherwise regular rhythm (see
Example 3
), or shortening or lengthening every note of a rhythm by the same duration (adding a semiquaver to every note in a rhythm on its repeat, for example).
[
106
]
This led Messiaen to use
rhythmic cells
that irregularly alternate between two and three units, a process that also occurs in Stravinsky's
The Rite of Spring
, which Messiaen admired.
[
107
]

A factor that contributes to Messiaen's suspension of the conventional perception of time in his music is the extremely slow tempos he often specifies (the fifth movement
Louange à l'eternité de Jésus
of
Quatuor
is actually given the tempo marking
infiniment lent
).
[
108
]
Messiaen also used the concept of "chromatic durations", for example in his
Soixante-quatre durées
from
Livre d'orgue
(
listen
ⓘ
), which is built from, in Messiaen's words, "64 chromatic durations from 1 to 64 demisemiquavers [thirty-second notes]—invested in groups of 4, from the ends to the centre, forwards and backwards alternately—treated as a retrograde canon. The whole peopled with birdsong."
[
109
]

In addition to making harmonic use of the modes of limited transposition, Messiaen cited the
harmonic series
as a physical phenomenon that gives chords a context he felt was missing in purely serial music.
[
110
]
An example of Messiaen's use of this phenomenon, which he called "resonance", is the last two bars of his first piano
Prélude
,
La colombe
("The dove"): the chord is built from harmonics of the fundamental note E.
[
111
]

Messiaen also composed music in which the lowest, or fundamental, note is combined with higher notes or chords played much more quietly. These higher notes, far from being perceived as conventional harmony, function as harmonics that alter the timbre of the fundamental note like
mixture stops
on a
pipe organ
.
[
112
]
An example is the song of the golden oriole in
Le loriot
of the
Catalogue d'oiseaux
for solo piano (
Example 4
).

In his use of conventional diatonic chords, Messiaen often transcended their historical connotations (for example, with his frequent use of the
added sixth chord
as a
resolution
).
[
113
]

Birdsong fascinated Messiaen from an early age, and in this he found encouragement from Dukas, who reportedly urged his pupils to "listen to the birds". Messiaen included stylised birdsong in some of his early compositions (including
L'abîme d'oiseaux
from the
Quatuor pour la fin du temps
), integrating it into his sound-world by techniques like the modes of limited transposition and chord colouration. His evocations of birdsong became increasingly sophisticated, and with
Le réveil des oiseaux
this process reached maturity, the whole piece being built from birdsong: in effect it is a
dawn chorus
for orchestra. The same can be said for "Epode", the five-minute sixth movement of
Chronochromie
, which is scored for 18 violins, each playing a different birdsong. Messiaen notated the bird species with the music in the score (examples 1 and 4). The pieces are not simple transcriptions; even the works with purely bird-inspired titles, such as
Catalogue d'oiseaux
and
Fauvette des jardins
, are tone poems evoking the landscape, its colours and atmosphere.
[
114
]

For a few compositions, Messiaen created scales for duration, attack and timbre analogous to the chromatic pitch scale. He expressed annoyance at the historical importance given to one of these works,
Mode de valeurs et d'intensités
, by musicologists intent on crediting him with the invention of "total serialism".
[
90
]

Messiaen later introduced what he called a "communicable language", a "musical alphabet" to encode sentences. He first used this technique in his
Méditations sur le Mystère de la Sainte Trinité
for organ; where the "alphabet" includes motifs for the concepts
to have
,
to be
and
God
, while the sentences encoded feature sections from the writings of
St. Thomas Aquinas
.
